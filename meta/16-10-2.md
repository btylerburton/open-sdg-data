indicator: 16.10.2
indicator_definition: "For this indicator, the operative words are \"existence\" and\
  \ \"implementation\". As such, it establishes: (a) whether a country (or at the\
  \ global level, the number of countries) has constitutional, statutory and/or policy\
  \ guarantees for public access to information; (b) the extent to which such national\
  \ guarantees reflect 'international agreements' (e.g. Universal Declaration of Human\
  \ Rights, etc.); and (c) the implementation mechanisms in place for such guarantees,\
  \ including the following variables: \tGovernment efforts to publicly promote the\
  \ right to information. \tCitizens' awareness of their legal right to information\
  \ and their ability to utilise it effectively. \tThe capacity of public bodies to\
  \ provide information upon request by the public. This indicator will thus collate\
  \ data from multiple sources, including National Human Rights Institutions, national\
  \ and international non-governmental organisations, academic institutions, and national\
  \ media regulatory authorities, among others. Such information will be gathered,\
  \ processed and checked by international organisations - UNESCO and World Bank.\
  \ UNESCO collects some aspects of this data using the Media Development Indicators,\
  \ in addition to the biennial World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development\
  \ report. Data are available for at least 195 countries."

rationale_interpretation: "The definition here relates directly to \"public access\
  \ to information\", which is wider than, but is also very much based upon, the established\
  \ fundamental freedoms of expression and association. \n(Conversely, these freedoms\
  \ also both impact on the environment for public access to information). \nThe focus\
  \ of this indicator is thus on the status of adoption and implementation of constitutional,\
  \ statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information. \nAs suggested\
  \ by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and UNESCO in earlier\
  \ presentations to the UN Technical Support Team (UN TST), this is a relevant and\
  \ measurable indicator. \nIt also responds to the growing number of UN member states\
  \ that have already adopted legal guarantees, and many others that are currently\
  \ considering relevant legislation or regulation in the field. \nThe rationale for\
  \ assessing the implementation dimension is to assess the relevance of legal steps\
  \ to practical information accessibility. It is not a composite indicator, but a\
  \ logical linkage of laws and policies to practical impact that is relevant to SDG\
  \ concerns. \nThe practical guarantee of public access may be partially assessed\
  \ through dimensions such as those unpacked by The World Bank. In this way, the\
  \ practical quality of legal provisions can be established by identifying if there\
  \ are: 1) proactive disclosure provisions in laws that establish a legal duty to\
  \ disclose; 2) mechanisms for citizens, firms, and others to request information\
  \ that has not been proactively disclosed but that is relevant to their interests,\
  \ 3) narrowly-tailored guidelines on exemptions to disclosure, and 4) institutional\
  \ structures that support disclosure, such as information commissioners, oversight\
  \ mechanisms, and complaints mechanisms. In some national cases, there is also information\
  \ on the sources and numbers of requests and the response time taken to process\
  \ these requests. \nUNESCO, within its mandate for the right to freedom of expression,\
  \ which includes the corollary of the right to freedom of information, already monitors\
  \ progress and issues in this area through its existing submissions to the Universal\
  \ Periodic Review (UPR) and regularly issued research reports on World Trends on\
  \ Freedom of Expression and Media Development, including its Media Development Indicators\
  \ assessments. Collaboration with the World Bank is foreseen, as well as drawing\
  \ upon work undertaken by ARTICLE 19 in this area. \nAll these will be considered\
  \ important aspects of establishing the existence and implementation of constitutional,\
  \ statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information."
