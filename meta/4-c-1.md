actual_indicator_available: 'Percentage of public elementary and secondary school
  teachers who have regular certification or probationary certification (only requiring
  fulfillment of a probationary employment period. '
actual_indicator_available_description: "The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) was\
  \ conducted by NCES seven times between 1987 through 2011. SASS was an integrated\
  \ study public and private school districts, schools, principals, and teachers designed\
  \ to provide descriptive data on the context of elementary and secondary education.\
  \ SASS covered a wide range of topics from teacher demand, teacher and principal\
  \ characteristics, general conditions in schools, principals' and teachers' perceptions\
  \ of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher compensation, district\
  \ hiring and retention practices, to basic characteristics of the student population.\
  \ After 2011–12, NCES redesigned SASS and named it the National Teacher and Principal\
  \ Survey (NTPS) to reflect the redesigned study's focus on the teacher and principal\
  \ labor market and on the state of K-12 school staff. NCES first conducted NTPS\
  \ in 2015–16 and released data in 2017. Variable name                         Description\
  \ of variable pctteachers_prep\t\t\t    Percent of public school teachers with certification,\

comments_and_limitations: Coverage of prekindergarten teachers is only partial. Many
  teachers teach more than one academic level, and included in the tabulation as multiple
  levels.

indicator: 4.c.1
indicator_definition: "From UNESCO:  The percentage of teachers by level of education\
  \ taught (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary) who have received\
  \ at least the minimum organized pedagogical teacher training pre-service and in-service\
  \ required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country. The indicator\
  \ should be calculated separately for public and private institutions. From OECD:\
  \ Teachers (ISCED 2 level) were asked to indicate whether they had participated\
  \ in any of the following activities 12 months prior to the survey: \tCourses/workshops\
  \ (on subject matter or methods and/or other education-related topics). \tEducation\
  \ conferences or seminars (where teachers and/or researchers present their research\
  \ results and discuss education problems). \tObservation visits to other schools.\
  \ \tObservation visits to business premises, public organisations, or non-governmental\
  \ organisations. \tIn-service training courses in business premises, public organisations\
  \ or non-governmental organisations. \tQualification programmes (e.g. a degree programme).\
  \ \tParticipation in a network of teachers formed specifically for the professional\
  \ development of teachers. \tIndividual or collaborative research on a topic of\
  \ professional interest. \tMentoring and/or peer observation and coaching as part\
  \ of a formal school arrangement"

rationale_interpretation: "From UNESCO: \n Teachers play a key role in ensuring the\
  \ quality of education provided. Ideally all teachers should receive adequate, appropriate\
  \ and relevant pedagogical training to teach at the chosen level of education and\
  \ be academically well-qualified in the subject(s) they are expected to teach. This\
  \ indicator measures the share of the teaching work force which is pedagogically\
  \ well-trained. \nFrom OECD: \nTo provide policy-relevant analysis on teachers'\
  \ participation in professional development activities through a robust indicator."
