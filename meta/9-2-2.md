actual_indicator_available: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment
actual_indicator_available_description: Total employment in all manufacturing activities
  divided by total employment in all economic activities.
computation_units: The ratio itself is simply the ratio of two employment series.
  The two employment series which are used to calculate this ratio are in millions
  of jobs.

indicator: 9.2.2
indicator_definition: 'From ILO:  This indicator is computed as the number of persons
  employed in the industry sector divided by total employment. Employed persons are
  defined as all those of working age who, during a short reference period, were engaged
  in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The industry
  sector comprises mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and public utilities
  (electricity, gas and water).  From UNIDO:  Employment is defined as a work performed
  for pay or profit. The value is obtained by summing up the number of employed in
  all manufacturing activities. The manufacturing employment indicator is presented
  in absolute terms as well as relative to total employment.'

rationale_interpretation: "From ILO: \n The industry sector, which is largely composed\
  \ of manufacturing, is central to the economy given its significant contribution\
  \ to national product and employment. It impacts also other aspects of life such\
  \ as health and the environment. The industry sector being a major source of job\
  \ creation (directly and indirectly), the study of trends and patterns of the share\
  \ and growth of employment in industry can reveal valuable information on the labour\
  \ market configuration and the situation in terms of social cohesion. \n\n From\
  \ UNIDO: \n This indicator represents the contribution of manufacturing in job creation.\
  \ It is universally important indicator. For industrialized countries it represents\
  \ sustained growth, for developing countries it shows the ability of manufacturing\
  \ to absorb surplus labour from traditional sectors. Compared to the indicator 9.2.1\
  \ it measures the labour productivity ' another key indicator for measuring technological\
  \ progress."

us_method_of_computation: 'Manufacturing employment data cover the following worker
  categories: employees (with source data from the BLS Current Establishment Statistics
  (CES) program), and self-employed workers (with source data from the BLS Current
  Population Survey (CPS)).

  Total economy employment data cover the following worker catetories: nonfarm employees
  (with source data from CES); self-employed workers, unpaid family workers, farm
  workers, and private household employees (with source data from CPS); and armed
  forces personnel (with source data from Department of Defense).
