indicator_definition: An occupational injury refers to any personal injury, disease
  or death resulting from an occupational accident, which is an unexpected and unplanned
  occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work
  which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death.
  A fatal occupational injury is the result of an occupational accident where death
  occurred within one year from the day of the accident, whereas non-fatal occupational
  injuries entail a loss of working time. The frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal
  occupational injury are calculated as the number of new cases of fatal and non-fatal
  occupational injury during the reference year respectively, divided by the total
  number of hours worked by the workers in the reference group during the reference
  year, multiplied by 1,000,000. The time lost due to occupational injuries refers
  to the total number of calendar days during which those persons temporarily incapacitated
  due to occupational injuries were unable to work, excluding the day of the accident,
  up to a maximum of one year.

rationale_interpretation: Occupational safety and health at work are vital components
  of decent work. The frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries
  and the time lost due to occupational injuries provide an indication of the extent
  to which workers are protected from work-related hazards and risks, and present
  information that is essential for planning preventive measures. Possible under-reporting
  of occupational injuries should be kept in mind when interpreting the data, and
  proper systems should be put in place to ensure the best reporting and data quality.
