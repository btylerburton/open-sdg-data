indicator: 11.7.2
indicator_definition: Number of girls and women aged 15+ who were subjected to physical
  or sexual harassment in the last 12 months, as percentage of all women aged 15+,
  disaggregated by perpetrator and place of occurrence (of latest episode). Many international
  bodies, national legislatures and courts have prohibited sexual harassment but there
  is no agreed universal definition of the term.[1] Most existing studies about sexual
  harassment are focused on working life or educational environments and measure unwelcome
  and unwanted sexual acts.[1,2] Because of the lack of universal definition, data
  for this indicator are not comparable. Currently, comparable data exist only for
  the 28 European Union countries (see below for more details on existing measures).

rationale_interpretation: "Sexual harassment is a violation of women's human rights\
  \ and a prohibited form of violence against women in many countries.[4] Sexually\
  \ harassing conduct causes devastating physical and psychological injuries to a\
  \ large percentage of women in workplaces around the world. In urban and rural areas,\
  \ developed or developing countries, women and girls are constantly subjected to\
  \ these forms of violence on streets, on public transport, in shopping centres and\
  \ in public parks, in and around schools and workplaces, in public sanitation facilities\
  \ and water and food distribution sites, or in their own neighborhoods. Such harassment\
  \ reinforces the subordination of women to men in society, violates women's dignity\
  \ and creates a health and safety hazard in public spaces. \nIf women and girls\
  \ are to enjoy a life free from violence, policymakers need to ensure that public\
  \ spaces are free from any form of violence, including sexual harassment."
