indicator_definition: Manufacturing value added (MVA) is the total value of goods
  and services net of intermediate consumption. It is generally compiled as the sum
  of the value added of all manufacturing activity units in operation in the reference
  period. It can be presented in percentage to gross domestic product (GDP) as well
  as per capita for any reference year. MVA growth rates are given at constant prices.

rationale_interpretation: MVA is a well-recognized and widely used indicator by researchers
  and policy makers to assess the level of industrialization of a country. MVA measures
  the contribution of manufacturing to economy. The indicator is exceptionally good
  for international comparison. Share of MVA in GDP establishes the role of manufacturing
  in the economy. In other words, this indicator specifies the contribution of the
  manufacturing sector to total production. MVA per capita is the basic indicator
  of a country's level of industrialization adjusted for the size of the economy.
  And finally, the MVA growth provides insight into the general direction and magnitude
  of growth for the manufacturing sector. In practice, it is a measure of the rate
  of change that an economy's MVA goes through from one year to another at constant
  prices.
