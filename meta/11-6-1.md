indicator: 11.6.1
indicator_definition: The recycling rate is the tonnage recycled from municipal waste
  divided by the total municipal waste arising. Recycling includes material recycling,
  composting and anaerobic digestion. Municipal waste consists to a large extent of
  waste generated by households, but may also include similar wastes generated by
  small businesses and public institutions and collected by the municipality; this
  latter part of municipal waste may vary from municipality to municipality and from
  country to country, depending on the local waste management system (Eurostat, 2013)

method_of_computation: Solid waste recycling = ( volume of waste recycled / total
  collected waste ) * 100  Benchmark  Min = 0% Max = 63.33% Calculated from data from
  2010 to 2012 available at Eurostat (2014). __* = 50 Obtained from European Parliament,
  Council of the European Union (2008). Standardization (S) see report for Standardization

rationale_interpretation: Recycling and reusing solid waste is a way to reduce the
  amount of waste to be disposed in landfills. A prosper city seeks to recycle the
  most part of its solid waste to increase the lifespan of its landfills and to profit
  solid waste as much as possible.
