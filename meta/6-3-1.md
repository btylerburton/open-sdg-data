indicator: 6.3.1
indicator_definition: Proportion of wastewater generated both by households (sewage
  and faecal sludge), as well as economic activities (based on ISIC categories) safely
  treated compared to total wastewater generated both through households and economic
  activities. While the definition conceptually includes wastewater generated from
  all economic activities, monitoring will focus on wastewater generated from hazardous
  industries (as defined by relevant ISIC categories).

indicator_sort_order: 06-03-01
indicator_variable: null
method_of_computation: The wastewater safely treated is calculated by combining the
  percentage of household (sewage and faecal sludge) wastewater and the percentage
  of wastewater from hazardous industries treated. Household surveys and censuses
  provide information on use of types of basic sanitation facilities. These estimates
  are combined with safety factors for on-site disposal and for transportation to
  designated places for safe disposal or treatment, as described in indicator 6.2.1.
  The information generated for indicator 6.2.1 will be combined with safety factors
  describing the proportion of wastewater from hazardous industries which is safely
  treated before disposal or reuse to produce indicator 6.3.1. Calculation of safety
  factors for household wastewater (sewage and faecal sludge) treatment will be coordinated
  with estimation of similar safety factors for safe management of sanitation required
  for indicator 6.2.1. The accompanying Statistical Note describes in more detail
  how 'safety factors' for wastewater treatment, disposal and reuse will be generated
  through a national assessment process, and combined with data on use of different
  types of sanitation facilities, as recorded in the current JMP database. Statistical
  methods for measurement of the wastewater treatment (called "wastewater to sewerage"by
  SEEA-Water) align with the SEEA definitions and treatment categories (primary, secondary,
  tertiary). Statistical methods for the treatment of industrial wastewater align
  with the SEEA definitions and treatment categories using ISIC classifications and
  treated volumes from permits data.

rationale_interpretation: "SDG proposed target calls for reducing water pollution,\
  \ minimizing release of hazardous chemical and increasing treatment and reuse. Household\
  \ wastewater includes faecal waste from onsite facilities (such as emptying and\
  \ cleaning of cesspools and septic tanks, sinks and pits) as well as off-site wastewater\
  \ treatment plants according to the ISIC definition 3700 for \"Sewerage\". Inclusion\
  \ of onsite facilities is critical from a public health, environment and equity\
  \ perspective since approximately two thirds people globally use on-site facilities.\
  \ \nIndustrial wastewater (which includes point source agricultural discharges)\
  \ responds to minimizing release of hazardous chemicals. Diffuse agricultural pollution\
  \ is a major source of water pollution but cannot be monitored at source and therefore\
  \ its impact on ambient water quality will be monitored under 6.3.2."

target: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping
  and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion
  of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.
