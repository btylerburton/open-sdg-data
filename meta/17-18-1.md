indicator: 17.18.1
indicator_definition: The ability of National Statistical Offices and other bodies
  within countries to report on the diversity of SDG indicators is itself a measure
  of capacity, particularly when we think about the eventual complexity of the indicator
  framework as well as the points of disaggregation. Right now, a number of the existing
  indicators are calculated or modeled at global level, and the purpose of this indicator
  is to measure the shift in that calculation process to the national level. Disaggregation
  would be assessed on the basis of the language of target 17.18, as well as the metadata
  and agreements on disaggregation for each indicator itself. The baseline and targets
  for this indicators will be determined in a later stage using trend data on the
  MDGs reporting and independent assessments of current capacity of countries for
  reporting towards the final results framework and indicators for the SDGs.
