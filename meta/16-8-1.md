indicator: 16.8.1
indicator_definition: "Representation and participation of developing countries in\
  \ international organizations, including international financial institutions, is\
  \ often below their relative weight in the world. This indicator would measure the\
  \ representativeness of developing countries in international organizations. This\
  \ indicator would be easily measurable by way of data collected by international\
  \ organizations. The indicator would require a list of international organizations\
  \ that would be included in the calculation. The indicator could be calculated by\
  \ taking the simple average of the international organizations on the list. The\
  \ phrase \"global governance\" in the target would suggest that the list of international\
  \ organizations should be limited to organizations with a global mandate, which\
  \ could, for example, include the governing bodies of all agencies, funds and programmes\
  \ of the UN system (including and the IMF and the World Bank), but also the Preparatory\
  \ Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO),\
  \ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Organisation for the Prohibition of\
  \ Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). This is a global\
  \ indicator, not a national indicator. National Statistical Offices need not be\
  \ involved. The rating CBB from the survey is, therefore, odd, especially the C\
  \ rating because the data on membership and voting rights is readily available,\
  \ for example, from the IMF and the World Bank. This indicator also relates to:\
  \ \tTarget 10.6 (which focuses on global international economic and financial institutions).\
  \ \tTarget 16.3 (rule of law at international level). \tTarget 16.7 (which focuses\
  \ on inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels)"

rationale_interpretation: "Representation and participation of developing countries\
  \ in international organizations, including international financial institutions,\
  \ is often below their relative weight in the world. This indicator would measure\
  \ the representativeness of developing countries in international organizations.\
  \ \nAn adjustment could be made to compare the percentage of members or voting rights\
  \ of developing countries in IFIs to their share in global population (e.g. for\
  \ governing bodies of UN funds and programmes) or GDP (e.g. for the IMF and World\
  \ Bank). This would allow compensation for the fact that the indicator should not\
  \ increase until reaching 100%."
