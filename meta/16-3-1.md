indicator: 16.3.1
indicator_definition: Number of victims of violent crime (physical or sexual assault)
  in the previous 12 months who reported their last incident to competent authorities
  or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms, as a percentage of
  all victims of crime in the previous 12 months. Competent authorities includes police,
  prosecutors or other authorities with competencies to investigate certain crimes
  (such as corruption or fraud), while 'other officially recognised conflict resolution
  mechanisms' may include a variety of institutions with a role in the informal justice
  or dispute resolution (e.g. tribal or religious leaders, village elders, community
  leaders), provided their role is officially recognised by state authorities.

method_of_computation: Data are derived from the National Crime Victimization Survey
  - a self-report survey in which interviewed persons are asked about the number and
  characteristics of victimization experienced during the prior 6 months. The responses
  are aggregated for a 12-month period (based on 2 interviews). The survey is administered
  to persons age 12 or older from a nationally representative sample of households.
  In 2016, 134,690 households and 224,520 persons age 12 or older were interviewed.
  The response rate was 78% for households and 84% for eligible persons.

rationale_interpretation: 'Reporting to competent authorities is the first step for
  crime victims to seek justice: if competent authorities are not alerted they are
  not in a condition to conduct proper investigations and administer justice. However,
  lack of trust and confidence in the ability of the police or other authorities to
  provide effective redress, or objective and subjective difficulties in accessing
  them, can influence negatively the reporting behaviour of crime victims. As such,
  reporting rates provide a direct measure of the confidence of victims of crime in
  the ability of the police or other authorities to provide assistance and bring perpetrators
  to justice. Reporting rates provide also a measure of the ''dark figure'' of crime,
  that is the proportion of crimes not reported to the police. Trends in reporting
  rates of violent crime can be used to monitor public trust and confidence in competent
  authorities on the basis of actual behaviours and not perceptions.'
