indicator: 3.2.2
indicator_definition: Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will
  die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age_specific mortality
  rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among
  live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early
  neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths,
  occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life.

method_of_computation: 'Number of children who died during the first 28 days of life
  / Number of live births Method of measurement Data from civil registration: The
  number of live births and the number of neonatal deaths are used to calculate age_
  specific rates. This system provides annual data. Data from household surveys: Calculations
  are based on full birth history, whereby women are asked for the date of birth of
  each of their children, whether each child is still alive and if not the age at
  death. Method of estimation The United Nation Inter_agency Group for Child Mortality
  Estimation (UN_IGME) produces neonatal mortality rate estimates with a Bayesian
  spline regression model which models the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under_five
  mortality rate''_''neonatal mortality rate). Estimates of NMR are obtained by recombining
  the estimates of the ratio with UN IGME_estimated under_five mortality rate. See
  UN IGME for more details. Predominant type of statistics: adjusted and estimated.
  These neonatal mortality rates have been estimated by applying methods to the available
  data from all Member States in order to ensure comparability across countries and
  time; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official national data.'

target: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of
  age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000
  live births.
