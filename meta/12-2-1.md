indicator: 12.2.1
indicator_definition: Material footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material
  extraction to domestic final demand of a country. It is calculated as raw material
  equivalent of imports (RMEIM) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material equivalents
  of exports (RMEEX). For the attribution of the primary material needs of final demand
  a global, multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework is employed. The attribution
  method based on I-O analytical tools is described in detail in Wiedmann et al. 2015.
  It is based on the EORA MRIO framework developed by the University of Sydney, Australia
  (Lenzen et al. 2013) which is an internationally well-established and the most detailed
  and reliable MRIO framework available to date.

method_of_computation: Material footprint of consumption reports the amount of primary
  materials required to serve final demand of a country and can be interpreted as
  an indicator for the material standard of living/level of capitalization of an economy.
  Per-capita MF describes the average material use for final demand. DMC and MF need
  to be looked at in combination as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production
  and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF
  the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand.
  A country can, for instance have a very high DMC because it has a large primary
  production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of
  the material intensive industrial processes to other countries. The material footprint
  corrects for both phenomena.
