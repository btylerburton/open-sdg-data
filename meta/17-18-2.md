us_method_of_computation: 'This is a dichotomous variable. In the US, several national
  laws providing this coverage are relevant. For coding purposes, we consider three
  most relevant: the Paperwork Reduction Act, which gives authority to the Administrator
  of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to designate a Chief Statistician
  with professional credentials and to designate the responsibility of ensuring official
  national statistics reflect relevance, accuracy, and objectivity. The Confidential
  Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act protects the confidentialty
  of information provided for solely statistical purposes. The Information Quality
  Act ensures that the quality of infomration collected is commesurate with its intended
  use and provides a means for the public to challenge (and thereby ensure) the quality
  of information collected.'
