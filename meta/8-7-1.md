indicator: 8.7.1
indicator_definition: "From ILO: The term child labour reflects the engagement of\
  \ children in prohibited work and, more generally, in types of work to be eliminated\
  \ as socially and morally undesirable as guided by national legislation, the ILO\
  \ Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138), and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention,\
  \ 1999 (No. 182), their respective supplementing Recommendations (Nos 146 and 190),\
  \ and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The statistical\
  \ measurement framework for child labour is structured around (i) the age of the\
  \ child; (ii) the productive activities by the child, including their nature and\
  \ the conditions under which these are performed, and the duration of engagement\
  \ by the child in such activities. For the purpose of statistical measurement, children\
  \ engaged in child labour include all persons aged 5 to 17 years who, during a specified\
  \ time period, were engaged in one or more of the following categories of activities:\
  \ \t(a) worst forms of child labour, (as described in paragraphs 17'30, 18th ICLS\
  \ resolution); \t(b) employment below the minimum age, (as described in paragraphs\
  \ 32 and 33 of the 18th ICLS resolution); and \t(c) hazardous unpaid household services,\
  \ (as described in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the 18th ICLS resolution), applicable\
  \ where the general production boundary is used as the measurement framework.  From\
  \ UNICEF:  This indicator provides the proportion of children aged 5-17 years who\
  \ are engaged in child labour. It is calculated by dividing the number of children\
  \ aged 5-17 years who are reported to have been engaged in child labour in the past\
  \ week by the total number of children aged 5-17 in the population."

rationale_interpretation: "From ILO: \nTo monitor the progress against the target\
  \ 8.7. Indicator is straightforward to interpret, as it gives the headcount of child\
  \ labourers at national, regional and global levels. \n\n From UNICEF: \n Children\
  \ around the world are routinely engaged in paid and unpaid forms of work that are\
  \ not harmful to them. However, children are considered to be involved in child\
  \ labour when they are either too young to work or are involved in activities harmful\
  \ to their health and development. Children's involvement in hazardous work can\
  \ compromise their physical, mental, social and educational development. \nThe issue\
  \ of child labour is guided by three main international conventions: ILO Convention\
  \ No. 138 concerning minimum age for admission to employment and Recommendation\
  \ No. 146 (1973); ILO Convention No. 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate\
  \ action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour and Recommendation\
  \ No. 190 (1999); and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article\
  \ 32), including its Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution\
  \ and child pornography. These conventions frame the concept of child labour and\
  \ form the basis for child labour legislation enacted by countries that are signatories.\
  \ \nAs per the 2008 Resolution concerning Statistics of Child Labour, the operation\
  \ definition of child labour is based on number of hours spent working and working\
  \ conditions, and encompasses both engagement in economic activities as well as\
  \ household chores."
