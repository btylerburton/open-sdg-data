rationale_interpretation: People and businesses need access to financial services
  that are safe, reliable, and convenient. The high costs of providing these services,
  particularly to those living and working in more remote areas or for those whose
  transaction values are low, have led to limited access. New technologies and delivery
  channels are lowering costs and bringing timely and appropriate services to even
  more people, but require the institutions providing or partnering to provide services
  to have the capability to design and deliver these services.
