actual_indicator_available: Estimated Number of Rape - Revised and Legacy Definitions
  Reported to the FBI UCR Program.
actual_indicator_available_description: 'This table contains estimated volume numbers
  based on both the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting
  (UCR) Program''s legacy and revised definitions of rape. The data do not include
  other forms of violence other than rape. The data include all rapes reported to
  the FBI UCR Program and are not limited to intimate partner. In 2013, the FBI UCR
  Program initiated the collection of rape data under a revised definition and removed
  the term “forcible” from the offense name. Column heading Year - is the year the
  data represents. Column Heading Revised Rape Definitions are the estimates of data
  collected under the revised rape definition: Penetration, no matter how slight,
  of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex
  organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. (This includes the offenses
  of rape, sodomy, and sexual assault with an object as converted from data submitted
  via the National Incident-Based Reporting System [NIBRS].) Column Heading Legacy
  Rape Definition are the estimates of data collected under the legacy rape definition:
  The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will Indicator data on
  sexual assault is available in the NIBRS; however, NIBRS currently represents less
  than 30% of the nation''s population and nonresponse cannot be modeled to adjust
  for bias because statistical sampling methodologies were not used.'
comments_and_limitations: The data do not include other forms of violence other than
  rape. The data include all rapes reported to the FBI UCR Program and are not limited
  to intimate partner. In 2013, the Summary UCR definition of rape was changed to
  “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or
  object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent
  of the victim.” The new definition updated the 80-year-old historical definition
  of rape which was “carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.”
  Effectively, the revised definition expands rape to include both male and female
  victims and offenders, and reflects the various forms of sexual penetration understood
  to be rape, especially nonconsenting acts of sodomy, and sexual assaults with objects.  https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/resource-pages/rape-addendum

  to physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner
  in the previous 12 months, by form of violence and by age

us_method_of_computation: Agencies submit data based on only one of these definitions.
  Within each population group size, the proportion of female rape victims was calculated
  from all NIBRS reports of rape, sodomy, and sexual assault with an object. For agencies
  that reported using the revised definition, the actual number of reported rapes
  was decreased by the calculated proportion to arrive at an estimate for the number
  of rapes using the legacy definition. Conversely, for agencies that reported using
  the legacy definition, the actual number of reported rapes was increased by the
  inverse of the proportion to arrive at an estimate for the number of rapes using
  the revised definition.
