indicator: 5.2.2
indicator_definition: "Number of girls and women aged 15+ who were subjected to sexual\
  \ violence by persons other than an intimate partner, as percentage of all girls\
  \ and women aged 15+, disaggregated by age and place of occurrence. Sexual violence\
  \ as defined in para 60 of the UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence\
  \ against Women: Statistical Surveys [1]: ... is any sort of harmful or unwanted\
  \ sexual behavior that is imposed on someone. It includes act of abusive sexual\
  \ contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts\
  \ with a woman without her consent, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, threats, exposure,\
  \ unwanted touching, incest, etc. A minimum list of acts of sexual violence, which\
  \ should be expanded depending on the specific country context, consists of the\
  \ following: (a) Rape: Refers to engaging in the non-consensual vaginal, anal, or\
  \ oral penetration of a sexual nature of the body of another person with any bodily\
  \ part or object, including through the use of physical violence and by putting\
  \ the victim in a situation where she cannot say no or complies because of fear;\
  \ (b) Attempted rape: Refers to attempting to have non-consensual sexual intercourse\
  \ through the use of force or threats; (c) Other sexual acts: Refers to: \tIntimate\
  \ touching without consent \tSexual acts other than intercourse forced by money\
  \ \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through threats of physical violence\
  \ \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through threats to the well-being\
  \ of family members \tUse of force or coercion to obtain unwanted sexual acts or\
  \ any sexual activity that the female partner finds degrading or humiliating \t\
  Other acts of sexual violence. The indicator specifically considers the following:\
  \ 1) sexual violence (separately from physical violence); 2) women and girls aged\
  \ 15+ who were subjected to sexual violence; and 3) by perpetrators who are persons\
  \ other than an intimate partner.  This indicator provides the proportion of ever-partnered\
  \ girls and women aged 15+ subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence\
  \ in the last 12 months by a current or former intimate partner. It is calculated\
  \ by dividing the number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ subjected to\
  \ physical, sexual or psychological in the last 12 months by a current or former\
  \ intimate partner by the total number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+\
  \ in the population."

rationale_interpretation: "Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive\
  \ human rights abuses in the world today and takes place in all countries. In order\
  \ to eradicate violence against women and girls, it is necessary to measure its\
  \ prevalence in all its forms. \nBy measuring the prevalence of sexual violence\
  \ by persons other than an intimate partner, this indicator complements the other\
  \ priority indicator in 5.2 (i.e. the proportion of ever-partnered women and girls\
  \ aged 15+ subjected to physical, sexual and psychological violence by a current\
  \ or former intimate partner, in the last 12 months, by form of violence and age).\
  \ \nFurthermore, by disaggregating this indicator by place of occurrence and perpetrator,\
  \ this indicator would measure sexual violence in the workplace and in public spaces.\
  \ \n\n Intimate partner violence includes abuse perpetrated by a current or former\
  \ partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal\
  \ union. Violence directed at girls and women is the most common form of gender-based\
  \ violence."
