indicator: 5.3.2
indicator_definition: 'From UNICEF: This indicator provides the proportion of girls
  and women aged 15 to 49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting
  (FGM/C). It is calculated by dividing the number of girls and women aged 15-49 who
  have undergone FGM/C by the total number of girls and women aged 15-49 in the population
  From WHO: The numerator is the number of women and girls who have undergone a FGM
  procedure (Type 1 to IV). The denominator is the number of women and girls in the
  same population'

rationale_interpretation: "From UNICEF: \nFGM/C is a violation of girls' and women's\
  \ human rights. There is also a large body of literature documenting the adverse\
  \ health consequences of FGM/C over both the short and long term. FGM/C is condemned\
  \ by a number of international treaties and conventions including the Universal\
  \ Declaration of Human Right (Article 25). FGM/C can also be considered as a form\
  \ of violence against women, and therefore the UN Convention on the Elimination\
  \ of All Forms of Discrimination against Women can be invoked. Similarly, defining\
  \ it as a form of torture brings it under the rubric of the Convention against Torture\
  \ and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Moreover, since\
  \ FGM/C is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children\
  \ and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the\
  \ Rights of the Child. Existing national legislation in many countries also include\
  \ explicit bans against FGM/C. \n\nFrom WHO: \n Female genital mutilation (FGM)\
  \ comprises all procedures that involve the partial or total removal of external\
  \ genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons\
  \ [1]. Although it is internationally recognized as a violation of human rights\
  \ (including: the right to non-discrimination on the grounds of sex; the right to\
  \ life; the right to the highest attainable standard of health; the right to freedom\
  \ From torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and the rights of the child),\
  \ and legislation to prohibit the procedure has been put in place in many countries,\
  \ the practice has still been documented. \nWHO classifies FGM into four types:\
  \ [1] \n\tType I: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce (clitoridectomy).\
  \ \n\tType II: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with\
  \ or without excision of the labia majora (excision). \n\tType III: Narrowing of\
  \ the vaginal orifice with the creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning\
  \ the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris\
  \ (infibulation). \n\tType IV: All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia\
  \ for non-medical purposes, for example: pricking, pulling, piercing, incising,\
  \ scraping and cauterization. \nThe removal of or damage to healthy, normal genital\
  \ tissue interferes with the natural functioning of the body and causes several\
  \ immediate and long-term health consequences."
