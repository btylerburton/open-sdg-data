actual_indicator_available: "\tNumber of Human Trafficking Offenses Reported to the\
  \ FBI UCR Program.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"
actual_indicator_available_description: This table provides the total volume of human
  trafficking offenses, the volume of human trafficking - commercial sex acts, the
  volume of human trafficking - involuntary servitude, the number of reporting agencies,
  and the estimated population covered by the reporting agencies.  Column heading
  - Total Reported Human Trafficking Offenses - provides the total volume of human
  trafficking offenses reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform
  Crime Reporting (UCR) Program.  Column heading  - Commercial sex acts - provides
  the volume of human trafficking - commercial sex acts offenses reported to the FBI
  UCR Program.  Column heading - Involuntary servitude - provided the volume of human
  trafficking - involuntary servitude offenses reported to the FBI UCR Program.  Column
  heading - Number of Agencies Reporting Human Trafficking - provided the number of
  agencies reporting human trafficking data to the FBI UCR Program.  Column heading
  - Estimated Population Covered - provided the  estimated population covered by the
  reporting agencies.
comments_and_limitations: The FBI UCR Program began collecting these data in 2013.  The
  data used in creating this table were from all law enforcement agencies submitting
  one or more human trafficking incidents for at least 1 month of the calendar year.  The
  published data, therefore, do not necessarily represent reports from each participating
  agency for all 12 months of the calendar year and cannot be considered nationally
  representative.

  \ number of human trafficking - commercial sex acts offenses reported, the total\
  \ number of human trafficking - involuntary servitude offenses reported, the number\
  \ of agencies reporting human trafficking offenses, and the estimated population\
  \ of the reporting agencies.  \t\t\t\t\t\t"

indicator: 16.2.2
indicator_definition: 'From UNODC and OHCHR:  Trafficking in persons is defined as
  the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by
  means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of
  fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or
  of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person
  having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation
  shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other
  forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar
  to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs (The United Nations Protocol to Prevent
  Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, which
  is supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime).
  The number of victims is defined as the number of detected and estimated number
  of non-detected adult women and men and girls and boys (18-) who have been trafficked
  for different forms of trafficking in persons. The estimated ratio between the number
  of detected victims and the estimated number of non-detected victims can be used
  to estimate the total number of human trafficking victims at national, regional
  and global levels. In addition, the ratio can be used to measure the efficiency
  of countries to detect trafficking victims.  From Goal 16 TST Working Group:  This
  is an outcome indicator derived from administrative data. The indicator is computed
  as the total number of identified victims of trafficking divided by population (per
  100,000 persons). This indicator directly measures exploitation and trafficking,
  which are inadequately captured by the other proposed indicators. These human rights
  abuses affect both adults and children, and States have existing obligations to
  prevent them for both population groups.'

rationale_interpretation: "From UNODC and OHCHR: \n Human trafficking for different\
  \ forms of exploitation represents a major violation of victim's human rights, dignity\
  \ and inclusion to the society. It has an impact on a person's health and opportunities,\
  \ it creates economic inequalities and it is a threat to the personal security.\
  \ The regular production of figures on this indicator will allow the monitoring\
  \ of the impact of the anti-trafficking measures to the level of trafficking at\
  \ national, regional and global levels. It also helps to assess the capacity of\
  \ countries to detect and consequently support victims of trafficking. It will raise\
  \ awareness on the most prevalent forms of trafficking in persons in different parts\
  \ of the world. \n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n Trafficking in persons is\
  \ a universal form of modern-day slavery. Trafficked persons are often victims of\
  \ physical, sexual and psychological violence. The demand for cheap labour and sexual\
  \ services, coupled with criminal practices that seek to profit from the exploitation\
  \ of vulnerable people, is its main driver. Addressing this most egregious violation\
  \ of human rights would significantly contribute to one of the main priorities of\
  \ post-2015 namely to \"leave no one behind\" and has its legal basis in the UN\
  \ Convention on Transnational Organized Crime and the optional protocol on human\
  \ trafficking."

us_method_of_computation: The FBI began collecting these data in 2013 through the
  UCR Program’s Summary Reporting System and National Incident-Based Reporting System.  This
  table provides the volume of human trafficking offenses as reported, the number
  of reporting agencies, and the estimated population covered by the reporting agencies.  The
  data used in creating this table were from all law enforcement agencies submitting
  one or more human trafficking incidents for at least 1 month of the calendar year.
  The published data, therefore, do not necessarily represent reports from each participating
  agency for all 12 months of the calendar year. When the FBI determines that an agency’s
  data collection methodology does not comply with national UCR guidelines, the figure(s)
  for that agency’s offense(s) will not be included in the table, and the discrepancy
  will be explained in a footnote.
