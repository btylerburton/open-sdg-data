indicator: 17.8.1
indicator_definition: This indicator is defined as the proportion of individuals who
  used the Internet from any location in the last three months. The Internet is a
  worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication
  services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and
  data files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer
  _ it may also be by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.).
  Access can be via a fixed or mobile network. For countries that collect data on
  this indicator through an official survey, this indicator is calculated by dividing
  the total number of in-scope individuals using the Internet (from any location)
  in the last 3 months by the total number of in-scope individuals. For countries
  that have not carried out an official survey, data are estimated (by ITU) based
  on the number of Internet subscriptions and other socioeconomic indicators such
  as for example GNI per capita, and on the time series data of the indicator.

rationale_interpretation: "The Internet has become an increasingly important tool\
  \ to access public information, which is a relevant means to protect fundamental\
  \ freedoms. The number of Internet users has increased substantially over the last\
  \ decade and access to the Internet has changed the way people live, communicate,\
  \ work and do business. Internet uptake is a key indicator tracked by policy makers\
  \ and others to measure the development of the information society and the growth\
  \ of Internet content ' including user-generated content ' provides access to increasing\
  \ amounts of information and services. \nDespite growth in networks, services and\
  \ applications, information and communication technology (ICT) access and use is\
  \ still far from equally distributed, and many people cannot yet benefit from the\
  \ potential of the Internet. This indicator highlights the importance of Internet\
  \ use as a development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if\
  \ not properly addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains.\
  \ Classificatory variables for individuals using the Internet ' such as age, sex,\
  \ education level or labour force status ' can help identify digital divides in\
  \ individuals using the Internet. This information can contribute to the design\
  \ of targeted policies to overcome those divides. \nThe proportion of individuals\
  \ using the Internet is an established indicator and also one of the three ICT-related\
  \ Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators (for Target 8F). It is part of the\
  \ Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development's Core List of Indicators, which\
  \ has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (last time in 2014). It is\
  \ also included in the ITU ICT Development Index, and thus considered a key metric\
  \ for international comparisons of ICT developments."
