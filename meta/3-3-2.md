method_of_computation: 'Number of new and relapse TB cases arising in a specified
  time period / Number of person_years of exposure Method of measurement Direct measurement
  requires high_quality surveillance systems in which underreporting is negligible,
  and strong health systems so that underdiagnosis is also negligible; otherwise indirect
  estimates based on notification data and estimates of levels of underreporting and
  under_diagnosis. Method of estimation Estimates of TB incidence are produced through
  a consultative and analytical process led by WHO and are published annually. These
  estimates are based on annual case notifications, assessments of the quality and
  coverage of TB notification data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB disease
  and information from death (vital) registration systems.'''' Estimates of incidence
  for each country are derived, using one or more of the following approaches depending
  on available data: (i) incidence = case notifications/estimated proportion of cases
  detected; (ii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition; (iii) incidence = deaths/proportion
  of incident cases that die. Uncertainty bounds are provided in addition to best
  estimates. Details are available from TB impact measurement: policy and recommendations
  for how to assess the epidemiological burden of TB and the impact of TB control
  and from the online technical appendix to the WHO global tuberculosis report 2014.'
