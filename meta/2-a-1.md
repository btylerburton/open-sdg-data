indicator_definition: 'The Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) for Government Expenditures
  is defined as the Agriculture share of Government Expenditures, divided by the Agriculture
  Share of GDP, where Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and
  hunting sector. An AOI greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the
  agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative
  to its contribution to economic value-added. An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower
  orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government''s
  orientation to the agriculture sector. Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry,
  fishing and hunting sector, based on the Classification of the Functions of Government
  (COFOG) developed by the OECD and published by the United Nations Statistics Division
  (UNSD), found at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=4&Top=1&Lg=1.
  Government expenditures are all outlays or expenses associated with supporting a
  particular sector or purse, including compensation of employees, and subsidies and
  grants paid as transfers to individuals or corporations in that sector. For a full
  description, see the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, developed
  by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), found at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/.
  The Agriculture Share of GDP is measured by the ratio of Agriculture Value Added
  over GDP, based on official data reported by countries to the United Nations Statistics
  Division or to the OECD. The annual data and indicator, collected and compiled by
  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), can be found on the FAOSTAT
  domain at: http://faostat3.fao.org/download/I/IG/E, covering the periods 2001- 2012.'
