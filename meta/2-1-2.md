actual_indicator_available: 'Household food insecurity as measured by the US Department
  of Agriculture''s (USDA) Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement. '
actual_indicator_available_description: Food-insecure households had difficulty at
  some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack
  of resources. USDA's food insecurity statistics are similar in concept to those
  obtained with FAO's Food Insecurity Experience Scale. However, the threshold for
  food insecurity differs between the two data sources. FAO's measure of moderate
  or severe food insecurity is somewhat more severe than USDA's measure of food insecurity.
  Therefore, the prevalence of US food insecurity as measured by USDA is higher than
  the prevalence of US food insecurity as measured by FAO's Food Insecurity Experience
  Scale. FAO measures moderate or severe food insecurity among adults while USDA measures
  food insecurity among US households.
comments_and_limitations: The FAO Food Insecurity Experience Scale-Survey Module and
  US Household Food Security Survey Module questions are similar and both rely on
  the underlying Rasch measurement model to determine food insecurity. Where FAO's
  and USDA's measures of  food insecurity differ is in the threshold for food insecurity.
  The internationally comparable threshold for \ FAO's measure of moderate or severe
  food insecurity is set at a more severe level of food insecurity than is USDA's
  threshold for U.S. food insecurity. Thus, the prevelance of food insecurity as measured
  by USDA methods is not perfectly comparable to FAO's prevalence of moderate or severe
  food insecurity.

indicator_definition: These are in reality two related indicators, representing the
  percentage of individuals in the national adult population (15 or more years of
  age) that have experienced moderate or severe levels and severe levels of food insecurity
  respectively, during the previous year.Severity of food insecurity is defined as
  the extent to which people have difficulties in accessing food of adequate quality
  and/or quantity due to lack of money or other resources. Difficulties include also
  psychological concerns associated with the struggle in accessing food.

us_method_of_computation: 'USDA food security statistics are obtained from data collected
  in the Food Security Supplement to the Current Population Survey. The household
  food security statistics are based on a measure of food security calculated from
  responses to a series of questions about conditions and behaviors that characterize
  households when they are having difficulty meeting basic food needs. The US Household
  Food Security Survey Module includes three questions about food conditions of the
  household as a whole and seven about food conditions of adults in the household,
  and, if there are children in the household, an additional eight questions about
  their food conditions. The food security status of each interviewed household is
  determined by the number of food-insecure conditions and behaviors the household
  reports. Households are classified as food secure if they report no food-insecure
  conditions or only one or two food-insecure conditions. They are classified as food
  insecure if they report three or more food-insecure conditions. Households classified
  as food insecure were "at times unable to acquire adequate food for one or more
  household members because they had insufficient money and other resources for food".
