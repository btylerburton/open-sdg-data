indicator_definition: The gender wage gap measures the relative difference between
  the average hourly earnings for men and the average hourly earnings for women. It
  is computed as the difference between the gross average hourly earnings of male
  and female employees expressed as percentage of gross average hourly earnings of
  male employees. Earnings refers to regular remuneration received from employers,
  in cash and in kind, and includes direct wages and salaries for time worked or work
  done, remuneration for time not worked (e.g. paid annual leave), as well as bonuses
  and gratuities that are regularly received. It excludes contributions paid by employers
  to social security and pension schemes in respect of their employees, benefits received
  by employees under these schemes, and severance and termination pay.

rationale_interpretation: The gender wage gap measures the extent to which the wages
  of men differ from those of women and therefore directly addresses the target of
  "equal pay for work of equal value". When the gender pay gap equals "0", it denotes
  equality of earnings. Positive values reflect the extent to which women's earnings
  fall short of those received by men, where a value closer to "100" denotes more
  inequality than a value closer to "0". Negative values reflect the extent to which
  women's earnings are higher than men's.
