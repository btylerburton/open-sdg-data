indicator: 10.3.1
indicator_definition: International human rights law outlaws discrimination against
  population groups on the basis of specific characteristics or 'grounds'. The grounds
  of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law, as enshrined
  in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequently elaborated upon
  by international human rights mechanisms, include ethnicity, sex, age, income, geographic
  location, disability, religion, migratory or displacement status, civil status,
  sexual orientation and gender identity. While some grounds are common to all countries
  and follow standard definitions, such as sex, age or disability, the precise categories
  to be included under grounds such as ethnicity, geographic location and religion
  will vary according to national circumstances and should be determined in a participatory
  process at national level. The indicator is calculated as the percentage of persons
  reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed within the last
  12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international
  human rights law. This will be calculated using the full survey results, with techniques
  of imputation, estimation and data weighting to ensure a representative sample and
  data reliability.

rationale_interpretation: This outcome indicator provides a measure of how well non-discriminatory
  laws and policies are applied in practice, from the perspective of the population.
  It is based on personal experience rather than perception to ensure greater validity
  of data, as perceptions of the experience of others may themselves be affected by
  stereotyping.
