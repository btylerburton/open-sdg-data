actual_indicator_available: Data are based on indicators 4-1-1, 4-2-1, 4-2-2, 4-3-1,
  4-4-1, 4-6-1, 4-7-1.  Description of indicators are contained in meta data for those
  indicators.
actual_indicator_available_description: Descriptions of indicators are based on information
  in other  metaprovided in indicators  4-1-1, 4-2-1, 4-2-2, 4-3-1, 4-4-1, 4-6-1,
  4-7-1. Variable lists provided under other indicator metadata. Raw data are provided
  since there it would seem to be inappropriate to have some groups in the numerator
  on some metrics and in the denominator on others.
comments_and_limitations: Refer to metadata for specific indicators. Note that parity
  measures suggested above are highly sensitive to small differences and do not account
  for differences strictly due to standard errors of the samples. The problem with
  the suggested metric is compounded when comparing relatively small percentages.
  So, if 10 percent of males and 12 percent of females were enrolled at a particular
  level, and there was a standard error of .75 on each metric, there would be no significant
  difference yet the parity ratio as specified above would be .83 which might suggest
  a substantial difference. The two point difference flipping the perspective to 88
  and 90 percent enrolled would yield a metric of 98, which would be more in line
  with the non-significant difference. As a result of these concerns with the specified
  metrics and the nonlinear aspect of the metric, we strongly recommend a different
  approach be used to compare across countries when the differences from country to
  country in the raw metrics may be assumed to be very large.

indicator_definition: Parity indices require no additional data than the specific
  disaggregations of interest. They are simply the ratio of the indicator value for
  one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is
  the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.
