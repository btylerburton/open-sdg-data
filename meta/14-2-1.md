indicator: 14.2.1
indicator_definition: While requiring some further development for practical implementation,
  the indicator is similar to UNEP indicators to monitor progress on marine and coastal
  EBM under its biannual programme of work. UNEP, IOC and FAO are available to support
  countries in operationalizing the indicator. Linkages can be explored with IUCN's
  'Green List' and the 'Ocean Health Index'. A technical working group to finalise
  the details could be supported by UNEP, IOC, FAO winter/spring 2016.

rationale_interpretation: 'Moreover, 18 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans
  are currently working to develop a core set of common indicators to be used across
  regional seas for routing monitoring and reporting on the status of the marine environment.
  Several proposed indicators are relevant to 14.2, for example: (a) National ICZM
  guidelines and enabling legislation adopted; (b) Number of existing national and
  local coastal and marine plans incorporating climate change adaptation; (c) % national
  adaptation plans in place; (d) Fisheries measures in place (by-catch limits, area-based
  closures, recovery plans, capacity reduction measures); (e) Trends in critical habitat
  extent and condition; (f) Population pressure/urbanization: Length of coastal modification
  and km2 of coastal reclamation.'
