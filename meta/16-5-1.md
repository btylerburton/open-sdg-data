indicator_definition: 'Percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public
  official money, a gift or counter favour) or were asked for a bribe by these public
  officials, to a public official in the last 12 months, as a percentage of persons
  who had at least one contact with a public official in the same period. Bribery
  is the undue advantage (money, gift or a service) requested/offered by/to a public
  official in exchange for a special treatment. Administrative bribery is often intended
  as the type of bribery affecting citizens or businesses in their dealings with public
  administrations and/or civil servants: this form of bribery affects most countries

rationale_interpretation: Corruption is an antonym of equal accessibility to public
  services and of correct functioning of the economy; as such, it has a negative impact
  on fair distribution of resources and development opportunities. Besides, corruption
  erodes public trust in authorities and the rule of law; when administrative bribery
  becomes a recurrent experience of large sectors of the population and businesses,
  its negative effects have an enduring negative impact on democratic processes and
  justice. By providing a direct measure of the experience of bribery, this indicator
  provides an objective metrics of corruption, a yardstick to monitor progress in
  the fight against corruption.
