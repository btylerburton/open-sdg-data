indicator_definition: The number of new hepatitis B infections per 100,000 population
  in a given year is estimated from the prevalence of total antibodies against hepatitis
  B core antigen (Total anti_HBc) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive
  among children 5 years of age, adjusted for sampling design.

method_of_computation: Number of survey participants with Total anti_HBc and HBsAg
  positive test / Number in survey with Total anti_Hc/HBsAg result Method of measurement
  Total anti_HBc reflect cumulated incidence in the first five years of life while
  HBsAg reflect chronic infections that may evolve towards chronic liver diseases
  The sample of the serological survey must be drawn from the specific geographic
  region to be verified. For example if the purpose is to estimate national transmission
  of HBV (including mother_to_child transmission) then the sampling should be geographically
  representative of the population. Convenience sampling is not appropriate. The sample
  size should be adequate to show with 95% confidence HBsAg prevalence of less than
  1% with a precision of ' 0.5%. The target age is 5_years_old. Sampling 4 ' 6 year
  olds may be appropriate. The serosurvey is cross sectional and therefore a point
  estimate time. The shorter time periods of data collection are therefore preferred.
  Data on HBV birth dose exposure and B3 completion are drawn from official records.
  Where these are not available testing for HBsAb may be considered for the serosurvey.
  This is less preferable as it is more costly, but can also be done in addition.
  Specimen collection and transportation should be appropriate to minimize bias though
  specimen degradation in rural and remote areas. Where possible, it is advantageous
  to collect blood specimens for ELISA laboratory testing because the accuracy (sensitivity
  and specificity) is higher than for rapid tests. However in some locations only
  rapid tests will be available hence test selection is resource dependent. This should
  be considered in designing overall study methodology. When an appropriate sampling
  strategy and size are used and quality testing assays and laboratory procedures
  are employed,the HBsAg prevalence in the serosurvey should be representative of
  the incidence of childhood HBV transmission in the specific geographic region (or
  country) in this age group.
