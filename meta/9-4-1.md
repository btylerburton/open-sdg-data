indicator: 9.4.1
indicator_definition: CO2 emission per unit of value added is a ratio indicator between
  the carbon emission and value added. Carbon emission is estimated from the data
  on energy consumption.

rationale_interpretation: Carbon emission per unit of value added is a universal indicator
  for measuring the impact of industrial production on environment. It captures the
  intensity of energy use, energy efficiency of production technology and most importantly
  use of fossil fuels. This indicator can also be presented as CO2 emission per unit
  of output.
