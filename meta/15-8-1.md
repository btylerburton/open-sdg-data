indicator: 15.8.1
indicator_definition: This indicator measures the management response globally, by
  tracking invasive alien species legislation for control and prevention at national
  and international levels. The more countries with Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and
  Biosecurity related legislation, the greater the global commitment to controlling
  the threat to biodiversity from IAS. The larger the number of IAS-relevant international
  policies, and the greater the level of national commitment to these, the greater
  the global commitment to controlling IAS. The more international agreements a country
  is party to the more strongly committed the country is to controlling IAS.

rationale_interpretation: "The projection of the current trend of adoption of national\
  \ policies on invasive alien species projects a nonsignificant increase by 2020,\
  \ with a slowing of the rate of increase in the proportion of countries adopting\
  \ such legislation. The adoption of national and international policies on invasive\
  \ alien species may be a first step to combatting the spread of invasive alien species.\
  \ \nStrengths \n\tThis indicator covers 191 countries worldwide. Caveats \n\tThe\
  \ adoption of legislation does not necessarily indicate the existence of regulations\
  \ or policy to implement the legislation or how successful such implementation has\
  \ been on the ground There still remains a need for further indicator development\
  \ to make this link clearer. \n\tLegislation does not necessarily capture all efforts\
  \ against invasive alien species that are happening at the national level. \nCurrent\
  \ storyline \n55% of countries that are Party to the CBD have overarching national\
  \ legislation to prevent, control and/or limit the spread and impact of invasive\
  \ alien species. \n\n see report for related information \n Adoption of national\
  \ legislation relevant to the prevention or control of invasive alien species. Source:\
  \ McGeoch et al. (2010) Global indicators of alien species invasion: threats, biodiversity\
  \ impacts and responses. Diversity and Distributions, 16, 95-108. \nThis indicator\
  \ measures the adoption of national legislation relevant to the prevention or control\
  \ of invasive alien species. The global trend in policy response has been positive\
  \ for the few last decades and, since the publication of GBO3, the adoption of policies\
  \ against invasive alien species has significantly increased. \nAs reported in 2010,\
  \ 55% of the countries signatories to the CBD have enacted invasive alien species\
  \ relevant national legislation, and most CBD parties were signatory to at least\
  \ one of ten other multilateral agreements that cover IAS in some form. Among these\
  \ countries 8% are signatory to all 10 international agreements (McGeoch et al.\
  \ 2010). For example, the Council of Europe has been developing and adopting codes\
  \ of conduct addressing some key pathways (e.g. horticulture, botanic gardens, zoos,\
  \ hunting, or fishing) of invasive alien species. Moreover, once the European regulation\
  \ on invasive alien species is fully adopted, it will have major implications for\
  \ neighbouring countries, but also at a world scale, as the European institution\
  \ is a major partner for global trade. \nProducing this indicator nationally...\
  \ \nAll countries (191 in 2010) party to the Convention on Biological Diversity\
  \ (CBD) were included in this calculation. Ten multinational environment related\
  \ agreements were used to quantify trends in the adoption of IAS related policy.\
  \ National legislation related to the prevention, management and control of IAS\
  \ was recorded including year of enactment, type of legislation (prevention, management\
  \ etc.) and the data analysed to calculate the indicator. \nUse at the national\
  \ level... \nAs reported in 2010, 55% of the countries signatories to the CBD have\
  \ enacted invasive alien species relevant national legislation, and most CBD parties\

  \ \nThis indicator was first calculated in 2010 and there has been no update since.\
  \ Plans are to update this baseline, enhance it and make it available for global,\
  \ regional and national use."
