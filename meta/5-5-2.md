actual_indicator_available: OCCUPATION BY SEX FOR THE FULL-TIME, YEAR-ROUND CIVILIAN
  EMPLOYED POPULATION 16 YEARS AND OVER
actual_indicator_available_description: Proportion of females in full-time, year-round
  management occupations compared to proportion of males in full-time, year-round
  management occupations.
comments_and_limitations: The data for management workers for 2000, 2008, and 2009
  were converted to the 2010 Census occupation code list to make them comparable across
  time. The Census Bureau occupation code list follows the structure of the Standard
  Occupation Classification (SOC) system and is updated periodically. The SOC is expected
  to be revised again in 2018.

indicator_definition: "The indicator proposed measures the proportion of women in\
  \ leadership positions across a number of areas, including: \tin the executive branch\
  \ of government: \t\tNumber of women Heads of State and Governments as a percentage\
  \ of total (Tier 1) \t\tNumber of ministerial positions that are held by women as\
  \ a percentage of total (Tier 1 ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) \t\t\
  Number of leadership positions held by women in local governments as a percentage\
  \ of total (Tier 3) \tin the legislative branch of government: \t\tNumber of seats\
  \ in national parliaments held by women as a percentage of total (Tier 1 ' part\
  \ of Minimum set of gender indicators) \tin the judiciary branch of government and\
  \ law enforcement: \t\tNumber of women judges as a percentage of total (Tier 2 -\
  \ ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) \t\tNumber of women police officers\
  \ as a percentage of total (Tier 2 ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) ;\
  \ and \tthe share of managers in public and private sector enterprises that are\
  \ women (Tier 1 ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators). Some of these data\
  \ are already collected while others need further development. For example, UN Women\
  \ routinely collects data on women Heads of State and Government; the Inter-Parliamentary\
  \ Union (IPU) regularly collects data on the proportion of women ministers and in\
  \ parliaments; indicators on women in law enforcement are also readily available;\
  \ and ILO regularly publishes data on women managers using data from national labour\
  \ force surveys. Data on women's political participation at the local level have\
  \ not been as systematically collected at the global level. Measuring women's participation\
  \ in local government is important, however, because of the responsibilities of\
  \ local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is,\
  \ seats) available to women candidates at this level. To measure women's representation\
  \ in local governments, methodologies and standards are currently being developed\
  \ by UN Women and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG)."

rationale_interpretation: Women participate in politics and decision-making at all
  levels, in different functions and across all spheres. They participate as candidates
  for local, regional and national elections, members of parliament or local council,
  heads of state and government, ministers, members of political parties, leaders
  and managers of business. Capturing an accurate assessment of women's representation
  across these different forms of political and economic leadership is a key marker
  of progress in achieving gender equality and women's empowerment.

us_method_of_computation: Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability.
  The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented
  through the use of a margin of error. The margin of error for the data provided
  is +/-.2 (this is the 90 percent margin of error). The margin of error can be interpreted
  roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate
  minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and
  upper confidence bounds) contains the true value.  In addition to sampling variability,
  the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error. The effect of nonsampling error
  is not represented in these data. Occupation codes are 4-digit codes and are based
  on Standard Occupational Classification 2010.
