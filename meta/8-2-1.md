actual_indicator_available: Annual growth rate of business sector output per job
actual_indicator_available_description: The measure describes the relationship between
  real output and one measure of labor input involved in its production. Measures
  of growth in output per job show the changes from period to period in the amount
  of goods and services produced per job. They reflect the joint effects of many influences,
  including changes in technology; capital investment; level of output; utilization
  of capacity, energy, and materials; the organization of production; managerial skill;
  and the characteristics and effort of the work force.
comments_and_limitations: Business sector output is based on GDP, but includes only
  a subset of the goods and services included in GDP. The business sector comprises
  about 75 percent of GDP since it must exclude those portions of the economy for
  which productivity measures cannot be constructed. General government, the output
  of the employees of nonprofit institutions and private households, and the rental
  value of owner-occupied real estate are excluded.
