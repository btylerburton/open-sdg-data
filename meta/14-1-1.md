rationale_interpretation: "UNEP is available to assist operationalizing these proposed\
  \ indicators through the Global Nutrient Partnership and Marine Litter Partnership\
  \ working with IOC, GESAMP, others etc. The earlier proposed indicator on Nitrogen\
  \ Use Efficiency is to some extend embedded with the broader Index of Coastal Eutrophication\
  \ (ICEP). \nMoreover, 18 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans are currently\
  \ working to develop a core set of common indicators to be used across regional\
  \ seas for routing monitoring and reporting on the status of the marine environment.\
  \ Several proposed indicators are relevant to 14.1, for example: (a) Chlorophyll\
  \ a concentration as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass; (b) Locat'ons and frequency\
  \ of algal blooms reported (c) Trends for selected priority chemicals 'nclud'ng\
  \ POPs and heavy metals; (d) Quantification and class'f'cat'on of beach litter items,\
  \ as well as indicators related to management of marine pollution and debris."
