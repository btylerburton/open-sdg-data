indicator: 2.4.1
indicator_definition: 'The denominator, agricultural area, is a well-known and established
  indicator that are collected by statistical bodies in countries and compiled internationally
  via a questionnaire by FAO. These data are available in FAO''s database FAOSTAT.
  The numerator captures the three dimensions of sustainable production: environmental,
  economic and social. The measurement instrument '' farm surveys '' will give countries
  the flexibility to identify issues related to sustainability that are most relevant
  to priorities/challenges within these three dimensions. Land under productive and
  sustainable agriculture will be those farms that satisfy indicators selected across
  all three dimension'

rationale_interpretation: "There has been considerable discussion over the past thirty\
  \ years on how to define \"sustainable agriculture.\" Sustainability was often understood\
  \ mainly in its environmental dimension. Yet, it is well established that sustainability\
  \ needs to be considered in terms of its social, environmental and economic dimensions.\
  \ The indicator has been operationalized in order to capture its multidimensional\
  \ nature.\n The main points on which the indicator is based are as follows:\n \t\
  Maintain the natural resource base in order to ensure sufficient productivity for\
  \ the foreseeable future\n \tEnsure the generation of a level of income which is\
  \ sufficient to keep the livelihood of the entire family steadily above the poverty\
  \ line, and in accordance with the development objectives of the country.\n \tProvide\
  \ access to safety nets, ensure flexibility in front of market and natural shocks\
  \ and ensure clear ownership and tenure rights, with no discrimination on gender\
  \ basis.\n Challenges to sustainable agriculture vary within and across countries,\
  \ and by region and are affected by socio-economic and bio-physical conditions.\
  \ By defining sustainability across its three dimensions, countries can select those\
  \ metrics within their measurement instrument that best capture the priorities most\
  \ relevant to them.\n A set of possible metrics for each sustainability dimension\
  \ will be established in order to ensure relevance across the whole range of possible\
  \ socio-economic and bio-physical conditions. Farm surveys will be designed on the\
  \ basis of a limited set of these measurements, established at national level in\
  \ order to cover the most relevant aspects of these three dimensions of sustainability.\
  \ Each surveyed farm will be assessed against targets for each of these measurements,\
  \ decided at national level. Farms or areas that satisfy the targets in the three\
  \ dimensions would be considered as sustainable; otherwise no. Progress would be\
  \ measured against a benchmark, which would show trends over time."

target: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient
  agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain
  ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather,
  drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil
  quality.
