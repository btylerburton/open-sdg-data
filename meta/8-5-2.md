actual_indicator_available: Unemployment rate by disability status, sex, and age,
  2009-16 annual averages
actual_indicator_available_description: "The unemployment rate represents the number\
  \ of unemployed persons as a percent of the civilian labor force. Unemployed persons\
  \ are those who had no employment during the reference week, were available for\
  \ work at that time, and had made specific efforts to find employment sometime during\
  \ the 4-week period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to\
  \ be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking\
  \ for work to be classified as unemployed. The civilian labor force comprises all\
  \ persons classified as employed or unemployed. The CPS uses a set of six questions\
  \ to identify persons with disabilities. In the CPS, persons are classified as having\
  \ a disability if there is a response of \"\"yes\"\" to any of these questions:\
  \ 1.\tIs anyone deaf or does anyone have serious difficulty hearing? 2.\tIs anyone\
  \ blind or does anyone have serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses?\
  \ 3.\tBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does anyone have serious\
  \ difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions? 4.\tDoes anyone have\
  \ serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs? 5.\tDoes anyone have difficulty\
  \ dressing or bathing? 6.\tBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition,\
  \ does anyone have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office\
  \ or shopping?"
comments_and_limitations: The questions noted above were added to the CPS in June
  2008 to identify persons with a  disability in the civilian noninstitutional population
  age 16 and older. The collection of these data is sponsored by the Department of
  Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy. Statistics based on the CPS are
  subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. When a sample, rather than the entire
  population, is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample estimates may differ
  from the true population values they represent. The component of this difference
  that occurs because samples differ by chance is known as sampling error, and its
  variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. There is about a
  90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will
  differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the true population value because
  of sampling error. BLS analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level
  of confidence.  The CPS data also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling
  error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to sample a segment of the
  population,  inability to obtain information for all respondents in the sample,
  inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct information, and errors
  made in the collection or processing of the data.  Additional information about
  the reliability of data from the CPS and estimating standard errors is available
  at www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#reliability. CPS estimates are controlled to
  population totals that are available by age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity.
  These controls are developed by the Census Bureau and are based on complete population
  counts obtained in the decennial census. In the years between decennial censuses,
  they incorporate the latest information about population change (births, deaths,
  and net international migration). As part of its annual update of population estimates,
  the Census Bureau introduces adjustments to the total population controls. The updated
  controls typically have a negligible impact on unemployment rates and other ratios.
  The estimates of the population of persons with a disability are not controlled
  to independent population totals of persons with a disability because such data
  are not available. Without independent population totals, sample-based estimates
  are more apt to vary from one time period to the next. Information about population
  controls is available at www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#pop.

indicator_definition: The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the total number
  of unemployed (for a country or a specific group of workers) by the corresponding
  labour force, which itself is the sum of the total persons employed and unemployed
  in the group. Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age who
  were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified
  recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity.

rationale_interpretation: Information on unemployment by age illustrates the different
  dimensions of the lack of jobs for people of a given age group. For example, in
  a country where the youth unemployment rate is high and the ratio of the youth unemployment
  rate to the adult unemployment rate is close to one, it may be concluded that the
  problem of unemployment is not specific to youth, but is country-wide. The problem
  of unemployment is unequally distributed when, in addition to a high youth unemployment
  rate, the proportion of youth unemployment in total unemployment is high. In this
  case, employment policies might usefully be directed towards easing the entry of
  young people into the world of work.
