  transactions adopted under HIPAA. 2010 Population information is from 2010 Census

  from a components of change model that incorporates information on natural change
  (births, deaths) and net migration (net internal migration, net international migration)
  that has occurred in an area since a Census 2000 reference date for 2001-2009 estimates
  and Census 2010 for 2011-2014 estimates. 2013 metro/non-metro information is from
