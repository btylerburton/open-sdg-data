indicator: 5.6.1
indicator_definition: "From UN-WOMEN:  This is an indicator measuring specific decisions\
  \ by women (aged 15-49) on their own sexuality and reproduction. Interviewees will\
  \ have to provide a 'yes' answer to all three questions in order to count as a woman\
  \ who makes her own sexual and reproductive decisions. The first question looks\
  \ at the ability to say no to sexual intercourse as a critical condition of sexual\
  \ autonomy. The second question measures the woman's decision concerning using or\
  \ not using contraception. The third question measures the woman's decision about\
  \ reaching sexual and reproductive healthcare for her. The three questions are as\
  \ follows: \t1. Whether a woman can say no to her husband/partner if she does not\
  \ want to have sexual intercourse (DHS q. 1054) \t2. Whether using contraception\
  \ or not using contraception has been mainly the woman's decision (DHS phase 7 q.\
  \ 819 and 820) \t3. Whether a woman can make a decision about sexual and reproductive\
  \ healthcare for herself (DHS q.922 with added language)  From UNFPA:  The indicator\
  \ is based on three central elements measuring the empowerment of women (married,\
  \ in union and ever sexually active women) aged 15-49 to make the following decisions,\
  \ : (a) whether they are able to reject unwanted sexual relations; (b) using or\
  \ not using contraception; and (c) whether they can access sexual and reproductive\
  \ health care for herself."

method_of_computation: "From UN-WOMEN: Denominator: Women of reproductive age 15-49\
  \ Measurement: Indicator will be measured through DHS and MICS covering most of\
  \ low and middle income countries. In developed countries the indicator will be\
  \ measured through national household surveys  From UNFPA  \tThe methodology for\
  \ this indicator has been developed by UNFPA in close collaboration with UN Women\
  \ by building on available information from DHS surveys. These three questions are\
  \ already included in the DHS: (a) DHS q. 1054; (b) DHS Phase 7, q. 819 & 820; (c)\
  \ DHS q. 922). In all cases these questions are currently asked to women married\
  \ or in union. Therefore the denominator will need to be expanded to include ever\
  \ sexually active women. In the case of the last question, the current DHS question\
  \ just refers to 'healthcare for herself', not specifically SRH care, which will\
  \ need to be added. \tUNFPA is also compiling and analyzing data from available\
  \ countries across different regions to understand better how the indicator behaves\
  \ and whether some additional tweaking will be needed in the formulation of the\
  \ indicator and its specific components. \tIn DHS, the indicator is already disaggregated\
  \ by location, economic quintile, and education. For the component related to contraceptive\
  \ use the indicator is also disaggregated by method of contraception. The proposal\
  \ is to add age, marital status (married, in union, unmarried) and disability."
