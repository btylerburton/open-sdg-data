actual_indicator_available_description: Total Farms, Acres Irrigated, Acre-feet of
  water applied
comments_and_limitations: 'All Years: Excluded from these data are institutional,
  research, and experimental operations. Data are strictly for water used for irrigation
  on farm land only. 2008: Data does not include non-horticultural land use for horticultural
  operations. 2003: Data contains horticultural operations which reported $10,000
  or less in sales. Horticultural operations with $10,000 or more in sales were not
  included. The U.S. Geological Survey conducts a water resource census every five
  years which includes all water use within the country http://water.usgs.gov/watercensus/  there
  is also a water use website http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/'

indicator: 6.5.1
indicator_definition: This indicator reflects the extent to which integrated water
  resources management (IWRM) is implemented. It takes into account the various users
  and uses of water with the aim of promoting positive social, economic and environmental
  impacts on all levels, including transboundary, where appropriate.

indicator_sort_order: 06-05-01
indicator_variable: acres_irrigated
method_of_computation: 'National surveys are structured in 4 components: policies,
  institutions, management tools, and financing. Within each component there are questions
  with defined response options giving scores of 0- 100. Questions scores are aggregated
  to the component level, and each component score is equally weighted to give an
  aggregated indicator score of 0-100. The method builds on official UN IWRM status
  reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the
  UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992).'
national_geographical_coverage: United States
periodicity: Every five years
published: true
rationale_interpretation: The indicator captures the degree of implementation of all
  main elements of IWRM. It supports decision making at the country level, as results
  can be disaggregated to review progress on different aspects. This will strengthen
  stakeholder participation, transparency and accountability. It also enables countries
  to identify barriers to progress and ways in which they can be addressed. It also
  facilitates coherence between the various targets within the water and sanitation
  goal by supporting water monitoring, planning and evaluation, as well as associated
  capacity building and thus the achievement of the overall water goal.

us_method_of_computation: 'National Agricultural Statistics Service: Data are derived
  from the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) sampled from the Census of Agriculture
  irrigation data. Farm definition: A farm is any place from which $1,000 or more
  of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold,
  during the census or survey year. Acre-feet of water: An acre-foot of water is the
  quantity of water required to cover one acre to a depth of one foot. This is equivalent
  to 43,560 cubic feet or 325,851 gallons. Acres irrigated: Acres or area irrigated
  are the acres of agricultural land to which water was applied by any artificial
  or controlled means such as sprinklers, flooding, furrows, ditches, gated pipe,
  hand watered, capillary mats, trough irrigation, ebb-and-flood irrigation, sub-irrigation,
  and spreader dikes including pre-planted, partial, and supplemental irrigation.
  Land flooded was to be included as irrigated only if the water was diverted to agricultural
  land by dams, canals, or other works.'
