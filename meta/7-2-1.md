rationale_interpretation: The target "By 2030, increase substantially the share of
  renewable energy in the global energy mix" impacts all three dimensions of sustainable
  development. Renewable energy technologies represent a major element in strategies
  for greening economies everywhere in the world and for tackling the critical global
  problem of climate change. A number of definitions of renewable energy exist; what
  they have in common is highlighting as renewable all forms of energy that their
  consumption does not deplete their availability in the future. These include solar,
  wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal resources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy,
  which can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can be replaced within a short to medium-term
  frame). Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually
  consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which cannot
  always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids
  the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources are subject
  to significant energy losses along the production chain.
