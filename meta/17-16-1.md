indicator_definition: "A country is considered to have a mutual assessment of progress\
  \ in place when at least 4 out of 5 of the following criteria are met: \tAn aid\
  \ policy or partnership policy defines the country's development co-operation priorities.\
  \ \tNational targets for effective development co-operation exist for both the developing\
  \ country government and providers of development co-operation. \tProgress has been\
  \ assessed regularly and jointly by government and providers at the senior level\
  \ in the past two years. \tLocal governments and non-executive stakeholders have\
  \ been actively involved in these reviews. \tThe comprehensive results of the review\
  \ have been made public in a timely manner."

rationale_interpretation: "Development processes are driven by the contributions and\
  \ the concerted efforts of multiple actors, including government authorities, providers\
  \ of development co-operation, the private sector, civil society and others. Strong\
  \ multi-stakeholder partnerships provide an enabling environment for greater development\
  \ effectiveness. In this regard, mutual accountability in between the relevant stakeholders\
  \ participating in development efforts can enhance the quality and strength of these\
  \ partnerships. \nMutual assessment reviews are national exercises that engage both\
  \ developing country authorities and providers of development co-operation, as well\
  \ as other stakeholders, at the senior level in a mutual performance review. These\
  \ reviews should ideally be conducted through inclusive dialogues involving a broad\
  \ range of government ministries; providers of development co-operation (including\
  \ bilateral, multilateral, and global initiatives); as well as other stakeholders,\
  \ including parliamentarians, local governments, the private sector, and civil society\
  \ organisations (referred to as \"non-executive\" stakeholders). These assessments\
  \ should be done regularly (every one to two years)."
