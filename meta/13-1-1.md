rationale_interpretation: "The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2013\
  \ calls for national governments to adopt and implement national DRR strategies\
  \ with their own targets, indicators and timeframes. \nImpacts of climate change\
  \ on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea\
  \ level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and\
  \ related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity\
  \ and desertification) and extreme weather events. \nCities around the world, as\
  \ well as rural populations, witness growing disaster risks. Impacts of climate\
  \ change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events\
  \ (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat\
  \ and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity\
  \ and desertification) and extreme weather events. \nCities are some of the most\
  \ vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal\
  \ settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability\
  \ to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over\
  \ half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the worlds 33 mega cities lie\
  \ in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by\
  \ sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis\
  \ and storm surges) due to the undermining natural protective barriers, low levels\
  \ of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas\
  \ and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to\
  \ unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain\
  \ perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable\
  \ to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short impact and duration\
  \ can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related\
  \ to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. Better management\
  \ of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by\
  \ both reducing the likelihood of natural hazard events and offering resources to\
  \ help cope with them. \nThese challenges require enhanced vulnerability and impact\
  \ assessments, mitigation and adaptation plans, resilience building and DRR strategies.\
  \ It is necessary to adapt to climate change, enhance resilience of ecosystems,\
  \ and reduce disaster risk and build resilience to natural disasters. \nProactive\
  \ DRR strategies will address climate change impact and enhance resilience of nations.\
  \ Resilient infrastructures will be critical part of such strategies because infrastructures\
  \ such as health, education, road and other critical infrastructures will have direct\
  \ impact on reducing inequality and making growth more inclusive. \nIncreasing number\
  \ of national governments that adopt and implement national DRR strategies will\
  \ contribute to sustainable development from economic, environmental and social\
  \ perspectives. \nThe indicator will build bridge between the SDGs and the Sendai\
  \ Framework for DRR because the adoption of national DRR strategies is one of Sendai\
  \ Framework targets and will be also monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring\
  \ System. \n(mainly based on TST Issue Brief 23, 12 and 20)"
