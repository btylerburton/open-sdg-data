actual_indicator_available: Does this indicator (LDC or small island developing states
  receiving support) apply to the US?
comments_and_limitations: The United States is not an LDC or a SIDS, although we prioritize
  support for these countries in the provision of climate-related support.

indicator: 13.b.1
indicator_definition: Number of LDCs that are receiving specialized support for raising
  capacities for effective climate change related planning and management, including
  focusing on women, youth, local and marginalized communities
indicator_name: global_indicators.13-b-1-title
indicator_sort_order: 13-0b-01
indicator_variable: ldc_sids_rcd_spprt_climate
national_geographical_coverage: United States
published: true
rationale_interpretation: As the effects of climate change are becoming more evident
  and acute, the need for effective climate services is greater than ever before.
  Climate services underpin climate action and achieving SDGs. Nevertheless, the GFCS
  High level Task Force had identified 70 countries that do not yet have sufficient
  capacities to develop and use climate services. This is a major focus of the GFCS.
  This indicator contributes and supports the achievement of several targets such
  as 1.5, 2.1, 6.1, 6.4, 6.5, 7.1, 9.1, 11.3, 11.5, 12.8, 13.1, 13.2, 14.2, 15.3.
