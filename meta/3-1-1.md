indicator: 3.1.1
indicator_definition: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to
  or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental
  causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy,
  irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100 000 live
  births, for a specified time period.

method_of_computation: 'Number of maternal deaths / Number of live births Method of
  measurement The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded
  (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the
  same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy
  status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination
  of pregnancy), and cause of death. The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated
  directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys
  or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to
  the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are
  often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account. Because
  maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if
  household surveys are used to identify recent maternal deaths in the household (e.g.
  last year). This may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals,
  limiting the usefulness for cross_country or over_time comparisons. To reduce sample
  size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and multiple indicator
  surveys (MICS4) measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival
  of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy_related
  mortality: regardless of the cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy,
  birth or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in
  the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio. Censuses have also included questions
  about maternal deaths with variable success. Reproductive Age Mortality Studies
  (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to
  identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these deaths
  are maternal or pregnancy_ related. Method of estimation For facility data_based
  maternal mortality, the denominator is estimated using population projections. WHO,
  UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Division and The World Bank have developed
  a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality
  issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves
  assessment of data for completeness and, where necessary, adjustment for underreporting
  and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical
  modelling for countries with no reliable national level data. Data on maternal mortality
  and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, the
  United Nations Population Division, UNICEF, and The World Bank. Data available from
  countries varies in terms of source and methods. Given the variability of the sources
  of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country
  estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation. Currently,
  only about one third of all countries/territories have reliable data available and
  do not need additional estimations. For about half of the countries included in
  the estimation process, country_reported estimates of maternal mortality are adjusted
  for the purposes of comparability of the methodologies. For the remainder of countries/territories
  '' those with no appropriate maternal mortality data''__''a statistical model is
  employed to predict maternal mortality levels. However, the calculated point estimates
  with this methodology might not represent the true levels of maternal mortality.
  It is advised to consider the estimates together with the reported uncertainty margins
  within which the true levels are known to lie. Predominant type of statistics: predicted.'
