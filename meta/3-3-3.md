method_of_computation: Number of malaria cases / Population at risk (number of people
  living in areas where malaria transmission occurs) Method of measurement Complete
  data on malaria cases reported through surveillance systems are the best source
  of data but are rarely available for large populations. Reported data on malaria
  cases generally need to be corrected for extent of health service use, incompleteness
  of reporting and lack of case confirmation. In high transmission areas with limited
  health service data but with good data on parasite prevalence the number of cases
  can be estimated from parasite prevalence.''The denominator is estimated, using
  risk mapping and population data. Method of estimation WHO compiles data on reported
  confirmed cases of malaria, submitted by national malaria control programmes and
  estimates the extent of underreporting.''Where necessary the number of cases are
  inferred from parasite prevalence surveys.''
