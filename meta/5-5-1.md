rationale_interpretation: "Women participate in politics and decision-making at all\
  \ levels, in different functions and across all spheres of government. They may\
  \ participate as voters, candidates for local, regional and national elections,\
  \ members of parliament or local council, heads of state and government, ministers,\
  \ members of political parties, trade unions or business associations, or as electoral\
  \ administrators. \nCapturing an accurate assessment of women's representation across\
  \ these different forms of political participation has been difficult, however.\
  \ The standard measure of women's political participation and involvement in decision-making,\
  \ used to track progress for the Millennium Development Goals, was the proportion\
  \ of seats held by women in national parliaments. In many respects, the existence\
  \ and quality of this data has meant that other areas of political participation\
  \ have not been paid sufficient attention. \nMeasuring women's participation in\
  \ local government is an additional, but equally important measure of women's political\
  \ participation and decision-making, because of the responsibilities of local governments\
  \ and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is seats) available\
  \ to women candidates at this level. Women's entry into local politics has the potential\
  \ to influence a wide range of policy decisions and local community programmes.\
  \ \nHowever, the available data is limited; it is neither comprehensive across all\
  \ countries, nor regularly updated. Data from the United Nations Statistical Division's\
  \ 2010 edition of The World's Women, for example, show selected regional averages,\
  \ with a low of 8 percent in Northern Africa to a high of 30 percent in sub-Saharan\
  \ Africa. Averages across Latin America and Europe ranged from 24 to 29 percent\
  \ and Asia reported averages below 20 percent. Drawing meaningful conclusions from\
  \ this data is therefore difficult. \nIn 1995, the Beijing Platform for Action called\
  \ on governments to accept a wider understanding of women's participation in decision-making\
  \ that went beyond women in national politics. The 20-year review of the Platform,\
  \ however, found that: \n\ta significant challenge for effectively monitoring progress\
  \ towards gender equality is the lack of high quality and comparable data, collected\
  \ over time. Many areas of statistics that are of critical importance such as '\
  \ women's participation in decision-making at all levels, including local government\
  \ ' are still not produced regularly by countries. Data and statistical requirements\
  \ for the post-2015 development agenda will be substantial, particularly for monitoring\
  \ gender equality, women's empowerment and the human rights of women and girls in\
  \ the new framework. \nA dedicated indicator on women's political participation\
  \ would provide the necessary 'data mandate' to ensure this data set is more systematically\
  \ collected across all countries and regularly monitored over time, allowing for\
  \ both international and longitudinal comparisons."
