actual_indicator_available_description: Proportion of individuals who use an Internet-connected
  mobile telephone, by sex, age 3 and over
comments_and_limitations: The 2011 and 2013 supplements directly asked whether individuals
  use a cellular phone or smartphone to access the Internet. The 2015 estimate represents
  those who 1) use a mobile phone, 2) use the Internet from any location, and 3) live
  in a household where someone accesses a mobile Internet service or data plan. Data
  from this source are not available prior to 2011. The next CPS Computer and Internet
  Use Supplement is scheduled for 2017-11.

indicator: 5.b.1
indicator_definition: This indicator is defined as the 'proportion of individuals
  who own a mobile telephone, by sex'. An individual owns a mobile cellular phone
  if he/she has a mobile cellular phone device with at least one active SIM card for
  personal use. Mobile cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for
  personal reasons (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are included.
  Individuals who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone device are excluded.
  Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that is not registered under
  his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is a SIM card that has been used
  in the last three months. A mobile (cellular) telephone refers to a portable telephone
  subscribing to a public mobile telephone service using cellular technology, which
  provides access to the PSTN. This includes analogue and digital cellular systems
  and technologies such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid
  subscriptions and prepaid accounts are included. Countries can collect data on this
  indicator through national household surveys.

method_of_computation: This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of
  in-scope individuals who own a mobile phone by the total number of in-scope individuals.

rationale_interpretation: "Mobile phone networks have spread rapidly over the last\
  \ decade and the number of mobile-cellular subscriptions is quasi equal to the number\
  \ of the people living on earth. However, not every person uses, or owns a mobile-cellular\
  \ telephone. Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important to track gender\
  \ equality since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if owned and not just\
  \ shared, provides women with a degree of independence and autonomy, including for\
  \ professional purposes. A number of studies have highlighted the link between mobile\
  \ phone ownership and empowerment, and productivity growth. \nExisting data on the\
  \ proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that less women than men own\
  \ a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the importance of mobile phone ownership\
  \ to track and to improve gender equality, and monitoring will help design targeted\
  \ policies to overcome the gender divide. The collection of this indicator was proposed\
  \ by the Task Group on Gender of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development."
