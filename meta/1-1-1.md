indicator: 1.1.1
indicator_definition: This indicator provides the proportion of the total population
    and the proportion of the employed population living in households with per-capita
    consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of US$1.25.
indicator_name: global_indicators.1-1-1-title
indicator_sort_order: 01-01-01
indicator_variable: null
method_of_computation: Calculated by dividing the number of persons living in households
    below the poverty line (disaggregated by sex, age and employment status) by the
    total number of persons (disaggregated by the same sex, age and employment status
    groups).
national_geographical_coverage: United States
published: true
rationale_interpretation: This indicator combines the poverty indicator under the
    first target (1a) of the MDGs on the eradication of poverty with the corresponding
    working indicator for monitoring the second target (1b) of the MDGs on decent work.
    By combining poverty status with employment status, the concept of the working poor
    is captured, which aims to measure how many workers, despite being in employment,
    live in poverty.
