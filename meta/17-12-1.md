indicator_definition: Similar calculations were already used for the calculation of
  MDG 8.7 (Average tariffs imposed by developed countries on agricultural products
  and textiles and clothing from developing countries). For reference purposes see
  the Millennium Development Goals Report 2015 available at http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf

rationale_interpretation: The reduction of average tariff on key sector as agriculture
  can represent a proxy of the level of commitment of developed country to improve
  market access conditions. As it was done for MDG 8.7, the term "key sector" has
  to be interpreted as those sectors of particular interest for LDCs and developing
  countries exports. The list of key sectors used by the MDG indicator 8.7 (i.e. agriculture,
  textile and clothing) might have to be reviewed.

target: Realize timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on
  a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with World Trade Organization
  decisions, including by ensuring that preferential rules of origin applicable to
  imports from least developed countries are transparent and simple, and contribute
  to facilitating market access.
