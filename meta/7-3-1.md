actual_indicator_available: Total Primary Energy Consumption per Real Dollar of GDP
  (Thousand Btu per Chained (2009) Dollar)
actual_indicator_available_description: From Table 1.7 of the  Energy Information
  Administration's Monthly Energy Review
computation_units: Energy intensity, defined as  thousand Btu per chained (2009) dollar

graph_type: line
has_metadata: true
indicator: 7.3.1
indicator_definition: Primary energy intensity is obtained by dividing total primary
  energy supply over gross domestic product. Total primary energy supply, as defined
  by the IEA, is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine
  and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. For international comparison purposes,
  GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.
indicator_name: global_indicators.7-3-1-title
indicator_sort_order: 07-03-01
indicator_variable: tot_prm_eny_con_dol_gdp
method_of_computation: Calculated as energy consumption divided by U.S. gross domestic
  product in chained (2009) dollars
national_geographical_coverage: United States
periodicity: Annual provided, monthly data also available
published: true
rationale_interpretation: Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is
  used to produce one unit of economic output. It is a proxy of the efficiency with
  which an economy is able to use energy to produce economic output. A lower ratio
  indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output.
