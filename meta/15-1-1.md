actual_indicator_available: Forest area as a percentage of total land area
actual_indicator_available_description: Forest area, as defined and measured by USDA
  Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, as a proportion of total U.S.
  land area as measured by U.S. Census.  Both measures are used as periodically reported
  to UN FAO and published in that organization’s Global Forest Resource Assessment
  (FAO GFRA)
comments_and_limitations: 'Forest area measures derived from inventory activities
  involve a complex mix of definitions, sampling protocols and statistical procedures.  General
  information on the USDA Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis program can
  be found at: http://www.fia.fs.fed.us/. A summary description of definitions and
  sampling protocols can be found at: http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/20371.
  The U.S. forest inventory is conducted on a continuous basis, with results compiled
  periodically, notably the five year compilations published in the Resource Planning
  Act Assessment (RPA, see: http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/gtr/gtr_wo091.pdf),  which
  are then submitted to UN FAO. The most recent RPA numbers were compiled for 2012
  and submitted to UN FAO for their 2015 GFRA report. The next set of RPA numbers
  will be compiled for 2017 and submitted to FAO for their 2020 GFRA report. Inventory
  results are sometimes subject to backward revisions, resulting in minor changes
  to previous period forest area estimates (for this reason, current submissions for
  SDG 15.1.1 do not exactly match past submissions for Millennium Development Goal
  7.1). Total Land Area and Inland Water Bodies are reported by U.S. Census on a ten
  year basis, the most recent of which was for 2010 and submitted to UN FAO for their
  2015 GFRA report.  These numbers have not changed considerably over the last two
  decades (FAO GFRA reports identical total land areas for 1990, 2000, 2005, 2010,
  and 2015).'

indicator: 15.1.1
indicator_definition: "The indicator is already included among the indicators for\
  \ the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (indicator 7.1 \"Proportion of land covered\
  \ by forest\") . In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is\
  \ crucial to provide a definition of \"Forest\" and \"Total Land Area\". According\
  \ to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as \"land spanning more than 0.5 hectares\
  \ with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or\
  \ trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is\
  \ predominantly under agricultural or urban land use\". More specifically: \tForest\
  \ is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant\
  \ land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters. \t\
  It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected\
  \ to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or\
  \ more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting\
  \ as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected\
  \ to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases,\
  \ justify that a longer time frame is used. \tIt includes forest roads, firebreaks\
  \ and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other\
  \ protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical,\
  \ cultural or spiritual interest. \tIt includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors\
  \ of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.\
  \ \tIt includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees\
  \ that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and\
  \ tree height of at least 5 meters. \tIt includes areas with mangroves in tidal\
  \ zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not. \tIt includes\
  \ rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. \tIt includes areas with\
  \ bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are\
  \ met. \tIt excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit\
  \ tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems\
  \ when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as\
  \ the \"Taungya\" system where crops are grown only during the first years of the\
  \ forest rotation should be classified as forest. Total land area is the total surface\
  \ area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and\
  \ lakes."
