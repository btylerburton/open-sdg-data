indicator_definition: Material footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material
  extraction to domestic final demand of a country. It is calculated as raw material
  equivalent of imports (RMEIM) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material equivalents
  of exports (RMEEX). For the attribution of the primary material needs of final demand
  a global, multi_regional input_output (MRIO) framework is employed. The attribution
  method based on I_O analytical tools is described in detail in Wiedmann et al. 2015.
  It is based on the EORA MRIO framework developed by the University of Sydney, Australia
  (Lenzen et al. 2013) which is an internationally well_established and the most detailed
  and reliable MRIO framework available to date.

rationale_interpretation: Material footprint of consumption reports the amount of
  primary materials required to serve final demand of a country and can be interpreted
  as an indicator for the material standard of living/level of capitalization of an
  economy. Per_capita MF describes the average material use for final demand. DMC
  and MF need to be looked at in combination as they cover the two aspects of the
  economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material
  in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service
  final demand. A country can, for instance have a very high DMC because it has a
  large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced
  most of the material intensive industrial processes to other countries. The material
  footprint corrects for both phenomena.
