  the number of cities that have data can vary from year to year.

rationale_interpretation: "Mean or average: Levels of air pollution can vary drastically\
  \ from day to day based on local weather conditions, geography, economic output,\
  \ etc. Articulating the indicator as annual mean is a more specific indicator for\
  \ monitoring the health and environmental impacts of sustainable growth and development\
  \ in cities over time. WHO air quality guidelines provide specific recommendations\
  \ on the mean levels of fine particulate matter which can support measuring the\
  \ per capita health impacts related to any improvements or degradation in air quality\
  \ in cities. Incidents of high air pollution levels also have health impacts, but\
  \ these are less important than longer term exposures, and related statistics are\
  \ less reliable in view of greater variability due to external factors, we therefore\
  \ do recommend a more specific articulation of this indicator to as annual means\
  \ as a way to monitor SDG achievement. \nFine particulate matter: Fine particulate\
  \ matter (i.e. PM2.5) can be directly linked to estimates of health risks. Coarse\
  \ particulate matter (i.e. PM10) measurements can be converted to PM2.5, but will\
  \ inherently introduce additional uncertainty to estimates of impacts (e.g. health).\
  \ Articulating this indicator to fine particulate matter increases its specificity\
  \ and its relevance for monitoring the health impacts of sustainable development\
  \ policies. \nPopulation weighted: The population size of cities vary within a country.\
  \ Weighting annual mean air quality measurements of fine PM by the city population\
  \ size relative to other cities in a country increases the suitability and measurability\
  \ of this indicator at a national scale. Furthermore it makes estimating the related\
  \ impacts on health and other sustainable development issues (e.g. improvements\
  \ in energy efficiency from sustainable transport) more feasbile and accurate for\
  \ monitoring progress."

  by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.

  (population weighted)

un_designated_tier: '1'
us_method_of_computation: 'Steps for computing the indicator: 1. Retrieved monitor-level
  annual mean values from EPA''s Air Quality System. (These annual means are the average
  of the four calendar quarter averages. At least 11 24-hour observations in each
  calendar quarter is required for the annual mean to be valid.  Otherwise it is invalid
  and not used.) 2. The highest annual mean among all monitors in each city (using
  Core Based Statistical Areas as defined by the United States Census Bureau) was
  computed to represent each city. 3. For each city, multiplied the maximum annual
  mean by the 2010 population. 4. Summed this population-weighted annual mean across
  all cities with data. 5. Divided this sum by the sum of all cities with data. 6.
  Resulting value is an average population-weighted concentration.'
