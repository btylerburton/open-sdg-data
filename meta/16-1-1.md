indicator_definition: "From UNODC:Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful\
  \ death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury\
  \ (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS\
  \ 2015); the rate is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide\
  \ divided by the total resident population, expressed per 100,000 population. From\
  \ Goal 16 TST Working Group:  This indicator is a composite indicator constructed\
  \ by collecting two numbers, deaths from intentional homicides and deaths from conflict\
  \ to measure \"peace\" with respect to target 1 ' \"Significantly reduce all forms\
  \ of violence and related deaths everywhere.\" The rates of intentional homicide\
  \ and conflict-related deaths should be reported separately, as combining them into\
  \ one single indicator would risk conflating two distinct phenomena with differing\
  \ root causes as well as varying levels of precision in measurement. Still, they\
  \ are useful complements to each other as, by construction, they are exclusive and\
  \ non-overlapping (ie. By design, their conjunction does not double count violent\
  \ deaths). Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon\
  \ a person with the intent of cause death or serious injury (Source: International\
  \ Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), 2015). ICCS recommends\
  \ that intentional homicides include: \tMurder \tHonour killing \tSerious assault\
  \ leading to death \tDeath as a result of terrorist activities \tDowry-related killings\
  \ \tFemicide \tInfanticide \tVoluntary manslaughter \tExtrajudicial killings \t\
  Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials Conflict-related\
  \ deaths refer to those deaths caused by warring parties, including, but not limited\
  \ to, those caused by traditional battlefield fighting and bombardments (battle-related\
  \ deaths). The term conflict-related death is broader than the term \"battlerelated\
  \ death\" as it includes killings that amount to war crimes, such as targeting of\
  \ civilians or of military 'hors combat', killings associated with a conflict (but\
  \ not accompanied by a battle between warring parties) such as one-sided killings,\
  \ pogroms and genocides. Following the ICCS definition (see homicides at left) death\
  \ as a result of terrorist activities would be included in intentional homicides.\
  \ For both intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths, rates are defined\
  \ as the total count in deaths in a calendar year, respectively, divided by the\
  \ total resident population for the year, expressed per 100,000 population. The\
  \ denominator (100,000 population) has been adopted globally by law enforcement\
  \ as the standard for comparable measurement."

rationale_interpretation: "From UNODC:\nThis indicator is widely used at national\
  \ and international level to measure the most extreme form of violent crime and\
  \ it also provides a direct indication of lack of security. Security from violence\
  \ is a pre-requisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies\
  \ and economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries\
  \ of the world and this indicator has a global applicability. Monitoring intentional\
  \ homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences\
  \ and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. \nIf data are\
  \ properly disaggregated (as suggested in the ICCS), the indicator can identify\
  \ the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including\
  \ partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other\
  \ forms of criminal activities) and political (including terrorism, hate crime).\
  \ \nThe interpretation of this indicator is straightforward also for non-specialised\
  \ users.\n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n As described above, this composite\
  \ indicator is comprised of two forms of violent deaths. Intentional homicides occur\
  \ in all countries of the world and have global applicability, while conflict-related\
  \ deaths occur in countries with ongoing conflicts/wars. Peace is a much broader\
  \ concept than violent deaths, however, it is difficult to measure many aspects\
  \ of peace (threats and the fear of violence, insecurity, and other forms of violence,\
  \ including damages to persons and property). Deaths due to violence are universally\
  \ and easily understood, are frequently monitored and are comparable with only minor\
  \ discrepancies in interpretation, largely due to the finality of death. Monitoring\
  \ intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes and consequences\
  \ and, in the longer term, to develop effective prevention measures. It is based\
  \ on statistical data routinely produced by law enforcement authorities and/or public\
  \ health institutions, with a high degree of international comparability. Conflict-related\
  \ deaths measure the direct impact of conflicts on populations in terms of losses\
  \ of life."

us_method_of_computation: 'These tables contain statistics for the entire United States.
  Because not all law enforcement agencies provide data for complete reporting periods,
  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimated crime numbers in these presentations.
  The FBI computes estimates for participating agencies that do not provide 12 months
  of complete data. For agencies supplying 3 to 11 months of data, the national Uniform
  Crime Reporting (UCR) Program estimates for the missing data by following a standard
  estimation procedure using the data provided by the agency. If an agency has supplied
  less than 3 months of data, the FBI computes estimates by using the known crime
  figures of similar areas within a state and assigning the same proportion of crime
  volumes to nonreporting agencies. The estimation process considers the following:
  population size covered by the agency; type of jurisdiction, e.g., police department
  versus sheriff’s office; and geographic location. Much of the data presented in
  the Crime in the United States publication are obtained from the Monthly Return
  of Offenses Known to Police form which is required to participate in the FBI UCR
  Program. Data sited from the FBI UCR Program’s website regarding the age and sex
  of a victim of homicide is obtained from the Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR).
  The SHR provides additional details surrounding the homicide such as victim and
  offender age, sex, and race, type of weapon, circumstance during a homicide, and
  the relationship of the victim to the offender. The SHR is not required for participation
  in the program. Murder victims with unknown age and/or sex are not included in this
  table. To calculate the estimated number of males, females, and age of the victim,
  the percent distribution was figured using data supplied to the national UCR Program
  on the SHR. The resulting figure was then applied to the total estimated number
  of homicides for the nation. The homicide rate, defined as the number of offenses
  per 100,000 population, is derived by first dividing the nation’s population by
  100,000 and then dividing the number of offenses by the resulting figure.'
