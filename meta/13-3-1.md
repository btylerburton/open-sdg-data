us_method_of_computation: Since the United States has a federal education system there
  is no nationally designated curricula for public or private schools.  While schools
  typically do cover some aspects of climate change science, there is a wide range
  in the scope and intensity of these curricula across state and local jurisdictions
  that make curricula decisions. A recent study by the National Center for Climate
  Change Education and Penn State University (http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/Outreach/TeacherWS_2016/plutzer16sci.pdf)
  found that nearly all students were exposed to at least some material on climate
  change during their school years. Three in four science teachers allocate at least
  an hour to discussing recent global warming in their formal lesson plans. Most science
  teachers reported covering the greenhouse effect (66%), the carbon cycle (63%),
  and four or more observable consequences, such as sea-level rise, or changes in
  seasonal patterns, like the flowering of plants and animal migrations. About 30%
  of teachers emphasized that recent global warming “is likely due to natural causes,”
  and 12% did not emphasize human causes. Of teachers who teach climate change, 31%
  reported emphasizing both the scientific consensus that recent global warming is
  due to human activity and that many scientists believe recent increases in temperature
  are due to natural causes.
