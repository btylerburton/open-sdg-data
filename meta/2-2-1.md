actual_indicator_available: Percent of US children from birth up to 5 years with height-for-age
  less than 2 standard deviations of the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards.

  for a 2-year period. The estimated percent meets the NCHS standards for reliability
  and precision.

target: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the
  internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years
  of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating
  women and older persons.

title: Prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2 standard deviation from the median
  of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under
  5 years of age
un_custodial_agency: 'UNICEF (Partnering agencies: WHO)'
un_designated_tier: '1'
us_method_of_computation: The number of children from birth through <5 years with
  height-for-age more than 2 standard deviations below the median length/height-for-age
  was divided by the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result
  was multiplied by 100.  The numbers and resulting estimate are weighted to be nationally
  representative.  The 2013-2014 NHANES data were merged with the expanded WHO growth
  chart files of length/height-for-age for boys and girls by age in days. Age in months
  at examination on the NHANES 2013-2014 file was converted to age in days by multiplying
  it by 30.4375 and taking the largest integer of the result.
