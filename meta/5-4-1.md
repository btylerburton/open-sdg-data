rationale_interpretation: "The provision of unpaid care and domestic work has a profound\
  \ implication on our understanding of poverty and well-being. As a result of their\
  \ socially ascribed roles, women and girls do the bulk of unpaid care and domestic\
  \ work, which includes household maintenance activities such as cooking and cleaning\
  \ as well as person-toperson care activities such as child and elder care. [2] \n\
  Producing time use statistics thus contributes to increasing the visibility of women's\
  \ work through better statistics on their contribution to the economy ' with particular\
  \ emphasis on the value of goods and services they produce. [1]"

  one time, by telephone, about how they spent their time on one day. Individuals
  have been interviewed for the ATUS on nearly every day since the survey began in
  2003. For information about ATUS methods, see the BLS Handbook of Methods:  https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/atus/home.htm.
  Data are estimates of average hours per day (see formula in section 7.4 of the ATUS
