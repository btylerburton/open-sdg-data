indicator_definition: Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow
  accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in
  a national economy. It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic
  extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials measured in
  metric tonnes. DMC measures the amount of materials that are used in economic processes.
  It does not include materials that are mobilized the process of domestic extraction
  but do not enter the economic process. DMC is based on official economic statistics
  and it requires some modelling to adapt the source data to the methodological requirements
  of the MFA. The accounting standard and accounting methods are set out in the EUROSTAT
  guidebooks for MFA accounts in the latest edition of 2013. MFA accounting is also
  part of the central framework of the System of integrated EnvironmentalEconomic
  Accounts (SEEA).

method_of_computation: DMC reports the amount of materials that are used that are
  used in a national economy. DMC is a territorial (production side) indicator. DMC
  also presents the amount of material that needs to be handled within an economy,
  which is either added to material stocks of buildings and transport infrastructure
  or used to fuel the economy as material throughput. DMC describes the physical dimension
  of economic processes and interactions. It can also be interpreted as long-term
  waste equivalent. Per-capita DMC describes the average level of material use in
  an economy ' an environmental pressure indicator - and is also referred to as metabolic
  profile.
