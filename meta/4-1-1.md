indicator: 4.1.1
indicator_definition: Percentage of children and young people at the end of primary
  and lower secondary levels of education achieving at least a minimum proficiency
  level in (a) reading and (b) mathematics. The minimum proficiency level will be
  measured relative to new common reading and numeracy scales currently in development.
  The indicator is calculated as the number of children and young people at the end
  of primary or lower secondary education achieving or exceeding the minimum proficiency
  level in the given subject, expressed as a percentage of all children and young
  people at the end of primary or lower secondary education.

us_method_of_computation: The main NAEP reports current information for the nation
  and specific geographic regions of the country. The assessment program includes
  students drawn from a sample from both public and private schools and reports results
  for student achievement at grades 4, 8, and 12. The main NAEP assessments follow
  the frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board and use the
  latest advances in assessment methodology. Because the assessment items reflect
  curricula associated with specific grade levels, the main NAEP uses samples of students
  at those grade levels.
