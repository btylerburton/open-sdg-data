  Freight Data - Metric tonnage of freight shipments by mode in millions.  '
actual_indicator_available_description: 'Passenger Data: Number of passengers multiplied
  by number of kilometers traveled; Freight Data: Tonnage of total freight shipped'
comments_and_limitations: Rail passenger-kilometer data are Amtrak only.  Commuter
  rail, light rail and subways are included under transit.  Amtrak data are a sum
  of the passenger-kilometer data for the twelve months of each calendar year.  Air
  passenger-kilometer data are for certified air carriers in domestic service.
computation_units: Passenger-kilometers, metric tonnes

disaggregation_categories: Mode of transportation
disaggregation_geography: United States - Passenger data includes travel in the United
  States.  Freight data includes domestic shipments and the U.S. portion of foreign
  shipments.

indicator_definition: 'Average parcel shipping time/parcel shipping time standards,
  by country, both for domestic and international parcel services, and by product:
  this is the level of reliability of domestic or international parcel delivery services
  and for different products exchanged between countries. This ratio is determined
  after dividing the average parcel shipping time by the standard shipping time expected
  for parcels delivery at the national or international level, and at the product
  level depending on data availability. An alternative way of computing a similar
  quality of service ratio would be to use the percentage of parcels actually delivered
  within the quality standard, i.e. within the standard for shipping times. The standard
  for shipping time is the expected end-to-end transit time and is often expressed
  as the posting day + one, two , three, four or five days depending on the country
  geography and distance between countries.'

method_of_computation: Passenger data – number of passengers multiplied by the distance
  traveled. Freight data – the Freight Analysis Framework incorporates data from the
  2012 Commodity Flow Survey, Transborder Freight Data, Foreign Trade Statistics,
  and a combination of sources for individual sectors including agriculture, energy
  extraction, construction, and other sectors. Both passenger and freight data have
  been converted to metric units.
national_geographical_coverage: United States
periodicity: Annual and monthly data
published: true
rationale_interpretation: With the strong development of national and international
  e-commerce, the quality of the postal and parcels delivery services is becoming
  a major concern for millions of enterprises and consumers transacting online. It
  is sometimes considered as a major hurdle by these market players and one of the
  challenges for trade facilitation, particularly for micro, small and medium-size
  enterprises interested in internationalizing their activities.
