indicator_definition: Total taxes as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
  In the OECD classification the term "taxes" is defined as compulsory unrequited
  payments to general government. The definition of government follows that of the
  2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). The important parts of the SNA's conceptual
  framework and its definitions of the various sectors of the economy have been reflected
  in the OECD's classification of taxes. The data are predominantly recorded on an
  accrual basis. Data on tax revenues are recorded without offsets for the administrative
  expenses connected with tax collection. GDP also follows the definition used in
  the SNA. The methodology used in compiling the OECD's internally comparable revenue
  statistics has been carefully developed and refined through consultation with national
  statisticians and tax policy makers for more than 40 years. It continues to evolve.

rationale_interpretation: The headline measure presents the total tax revenues received
  by the national government during the year, expressed as a percentage of GDP ' i.e.,
  total national income. Taxes include personal and corporate income taxes, taxes
  on property, value added taxes, excise taxes, tariffs, customs duties and social
  security contributions. The tax to GDP ratio is the leading indicator to estimate
  the financial domestic means of a government to conduct its programme, to raise
  resources to supply physical infrastructure, public goods and services. The tax
  to GDP ratio supports the development of effective tax systems and is an essential
  feature of a successful governance framework. Normalising the data, by dividing
  total revenues by GDP, enables easy comparisons across countries Comparable and
  consistent tax statistics, such as the tax to GDP ratio, facilitate transparent
  policy dialogue and provide policy makers with an important tool to assess alternative
  fiscal reforms and to undertake relevant policy actions.
