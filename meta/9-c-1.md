actual_indicator_available: 'Percentage of the U.S. population covered by at least
  a 3G mobile network.  Percentage of the U.S. population covered by at least a 2G
  mobile network.  '
actual_indicator_available_description: 'The definitions for the FCC indicators are:
  (1) percent of population covered by 3G or faster service, and (2) percent of population
  covered by 2G or faster service; where "3G" and "2G" have esssentialy the definitions
  given above.  "Coverage" here indicates that at least one operator can provide a
  signal above the required m1nimum, but it is not necessarily true that at least
  one operator is actually offering service at that speed.'
comments_and_limitations: 'The FCCâ€™s annual report, the Mobile Wireless Competition
  Report, prepared by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, usually includes the
  most recent year''s data on 3G+ and 2G+ coverage, either in the body of the report
  or in its associated web appendices and "quick facts."  These two time series were
  created by pulling data from the 6th through 20th annual reports.  Note the three
  different data/computation methods used over this period, as described above.  Other
  notes: (1) 2G+ coverage often appears in the reports simply as total mobile coverage,
  since "2G or faster" captures all digital air interfaces, and (1G) analog service
  is no longer offered. (2) Since the measures are 3G or faster and 2G or faster,
  it is the gap between the two figures that gives the coverage of 2G only, or narrowband,
  service. (3) Percentages are shown rounded to one decimal place, as presented in
  the public reports.  (4) "n/a" indicates "not available."'

indicator_definition: "The indicator percentage of the population covered by a mobile\
  \ network, broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living\
  \ within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they\
  \ are mobile phone subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the number\
  \ of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population\
  \ and multiplying by 100. The indicator is based on where the population lives,\
  \ and not where they work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators\
  \ offering the service, the maximum population number covered should be reported.\
  \ Coverage should refer to broadband (3G and more) and narrowband (2G) mobile-cellular\
  \ technologies and include: \t2G mobile population coverage: Mobile networks with\
  \ access to data communications (e.g. Internet) at downstream speeds below 256 kbit/s.\
  \ This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x and most\
  \ EDGE implementations. The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers\
  \ to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active\
  \ users of such services. \t3G and above mobile-population coverage: Refers to the\
  \ number of mobile-cellular subscriptions with access to data communications (e.g.\
  \ the Internet) at broadband downstream speeds (defined here as greater than or\
  \ equal to 256 kbit/s). The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers\
  \ to use broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active\
  \ users of such services. This includes all high-speed mobile-cellular telephone\
  \ subscriptions with access to data communications, and includes mobile-cellular\
  \ technologies such as WCDMA (UMTS) and associated technologies such as HSPA, CDMA2000\
  \ 1x EV-DO, mobile WiMAX 802.16e and LTE. It excludes low-speed mobilebroadband\
  \ subscriptions and fixed (wired) Internet subscriptions. As technologies evolve\
  \ and as more and more countries will deploy and commercialize more advanced mobilebroadband\
  \ networks (4G, 5G etc.), the indicator will include further breakdowns. ITU collects\
  \ data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from national telecommunication\
  \ regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Ministries,\
  \ who collect the data from licensed mobile-cellular operators. However, they are\
  \ likely to have different levels and locations of coverage. Another method would\
  \ be to request each operator's coverage maps, which can be overlaid with maps showing\
  \ the population of the country."

rationale_interpretation: "The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular\
  \ network can be considered as a minimum indicator for ICT access since it provides\
  \ people with the possibility to subscribe to and use mobile-cellular services to\
  \ communicate. Over the last decade, mobile-cellular networks have expanded rapidly\
  \ and helped overcome very basic infrastructure barriers that existed when fixed-telephone\
  \ networks ' often limited to urban and highly populated areas - were the dominant\
  \ telecommunication infrastructure. \nWhile 2G (narrowband) mobile-cellular networks\
  \ offer limited (and mainly voice-based) services, higher-speed networks provide\
  \ increasingly high-speed, reliable and high-quality access to the Internet and\
  \ its increasing amount of information, content, services, and applications. Mobile\
  \ networks are therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers, helping\
  \ people join the information society and benefit from the potential of ICTs, in\
  \ particular in least developed countries. \nThe indicator highlights the importance\
  \ of mobile networks in providing basic, as well as advanced communication services\
  \ and will help design targeted policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers,\
  \ and address the digital divide. Many governments track this indicator and have\
  \ set specific targets in terms of the mobile population coverage (by technology)\
  \ that operators must achieve."
