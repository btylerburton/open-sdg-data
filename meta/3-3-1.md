  Longitudinal data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely available
  for large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health facilities
  can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. HIV incidence can also be modelled
  using the Spectrum software. Method of estimation Modelling is currently used to
  estimate new infections and incidence. Prevalence data inform these models.
