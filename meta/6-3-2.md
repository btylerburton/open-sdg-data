indicator: 6.3.2
indicator_definition: 'Proportion of water bodies (area) in a country with good ambient
  water quality compared to all water bodies in the country. ''Good'' indicates an
  ambient water quality that does not damage ecosystem function and human health according
  to core ambient water quality indicators. Concept: Water quality is estimated based
  on a core set of five determinands that inform on major water quality impairments
  present in many parts of the world: total dissolved solids (TDS); percentage dissolved
  oxygen (% DO); dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN); dissolved inorganic phosphorus
  (DIP); and Escherichia coli (E. coli). As monitoring capacities and coverage vary
  between countries, a monitoring ladder is proposed. On the first rung, the number
  of determinands not meeting national water quality guidelines based on the existing
  monitoring sites are used to estimate the water quality. On the second rung, a water
  quality index is used to combine the determinand values in a statistically more
  robust manner, and the monitoring coverage increased. On consecutive rungs, the
  monitoring coverage can be step-wise increased and complementary determinands covering
  additional aspects of ambient water quality can be included depending on the national
  capacities and requirements enabling the indicator to inform on the status of ambient
  water quality in a more comprehensive way.'

method_of_computation: "The GEMS/Water1 water quality index approach is used as a\
  \ general model to calculate the index, in which measured determinand values are\
  \ compared to guideline values (proximity to target approach): \t1. Proximity-to-target\
  \ (PTT) scores for each determinand at single monitoring sites are calculated as\
  \ the difference between the temporal average (for the accounting period) of the\
  \ determinand concentration and the target divided by the range between the (winsorized)\
  \ minimum or maximum of the measured determinand concentration (for exceedance and\
  \ non-exceedance targets, respectively) and the target. The PTT scores are scaled\
  \ to the range between 0 and 100, where 100 indicates that the target is met and\
  \ decreasing scores indicate an increasing distance from the target. \t2. The water\
  \ quality index (WQI) at site level is computed as the arithmetic mean of the site-level\
  \ PTT scores for the selected determinands. The WQI scale can be divided into different\
  \ water quality categories, ranging from very bad to excellent. The thresholds for\
  \ these categories are country specific and should be reported in the monitoring\
  \ system by the individual countries \t3. For the spatial aggregation at the basin\
  \ level and country level, the water bodies are divided into stretches of homogenous\
  \ quality (between consecutive monitoring stations). \t4. The final indicator is\
  \ calculated from the proportion of the stretches with good quality compared to\
  \ all water bodies assessed."

rationale_interpretation: The proposed indicator informs on the quality of water bodies.
  The indicator allows for evaluating the impact of human development on ambient water
  quality and thus enables countries to assess the future services they can obtain
  from aquatic ecosystems (clean water for drinking, biodiversity, water for food
  production etc.). Water quality represents the actual outcome of all pollution and
  pollution reduction activities, and is thus essential to fully describe the environmental
  status of freshwater systems, as well as to fully report on target 6.3. Water quality
  also feeds into all other water-related targets, and the proposed indicator can
  be used to directly report on many other targets or parts of targets (refer to supplementary
  information).
