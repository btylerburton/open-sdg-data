indicator: 7.1.2
indicator_definition: 'The percentage of population with primary reliance on clean
  fuels and technology at the household level. From non-solid fuels to clean fuels
  Current global data collection focuses on the primary fuel used for cooking, categorized
  as solid or non-solid fuels, where solid fuels are considered polluting and non-modern,
  while non-solid fuels are considered clean. This single measure captures a good
  part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels, but fails to collect data on
  type of device or technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other
  polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating.
  New evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO ( i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor
  air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of
  addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health.
  These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets
  for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the
  home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal
  and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home.
  They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space
  heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health
  benefits. For this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines,
  access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as "access to clean
  fuels and technologies" rather than "access to non-solid fuels." This shift will
  help ensure that health and other "nexus" benefits are better counted, and thus
  realized. Definition Percent of population with primary reliance on clean* fuels
  and technologies at the household level. *"Clean" is defined by the emission rate
  targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene)
  included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household
  fuel combustion.'

method_of_computation: "The indicator is calculated as the number of people using\
  \ clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total\
  \ population reporting that any cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage.\
  \  Method of computation The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled\
  \ by WHO. The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices comes from about\
  \ 800 nationally representative survey and censuses. Survey sources include Demographic\
  \ and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator\
  \ Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), and other nationally developed\
  \ and implemented surveys. Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban\
  \ and rural population for a given year are obtained separately using a multilevel\
  \ model. The model only accounts for regions, countries and time as a spline function,\
  \ and estimates are restricted to values ranging from zero to one. More details\
  \ on the model are published elsewhere (Bonjour et al, 2013). Estimates for countries\
  \ with no available surveys were obtained as follows: \tWhen survey data is available\
  \ for a country, the regional populationweighted mean is used to derive aggregate\
  \ estimates at a regional or global level, however no country point estimate is\
  \ given for that country is reported \tCountries classified as high-income with\
  \ a Gross National Income (GNI) of more than US$ 12,746.- per capita are assumed\
  \ to have made a complete transition to using clean fuels and technologies as the\
  \ primary domestic energy source for cooking and the primary reliance on polluting\
  \ (unclean) fuels and technologies use is reported to be less than 5% and assumed\
  \ as zero for regional and global estimates. For estimating the fraction of the\
  \ population relying on clean fuels and technologies for heating and lighting, the\
  \ same methodology using survey data to derive country estimates for a particular\
  \ year will be used using the same above mentioned assumptions."

rationale_interpretation: "Primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies\n Cooking,\
  \ lighting and heating represent a large share of household energy use across the\
  \ low- and middle-income countries. For cooking and heating, households typically\
  \ rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with\
  \ inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). It\
  \ is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and\
  \ lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The\
  \ use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million\
  \ deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than TB, HIV and\
  \ malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean\
  \ fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances\
  \ by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission\
  \ rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for\
  \ their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as\
  \ a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner\
  \ community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels\
  \ and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. For this reason, clean cooking\
  \ forms part of the universal access objective under the UN Secretary General's\
  \ Sustainable Energy for All initiative."
