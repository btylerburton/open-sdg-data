actual_indicator_available: Percentage of public schools with Internet access for
  student use. Estimated percentage of public schools with basic drinking water, sanitation
  facilities, and hand washing facilities.
actual_indicator_available_description: The National Center for Education Statistics
  has not gathered information on student access to computers at school since 1998
  (98 percent). We are not aware of any data collection NCES has had of the number
  or percentage of schools with basic sanitation facilities. There was a physical
  accommodations survey done in the mid 1970s, but this is no longer at all relevant
  because it was done so long ago and so much progress has been made both with respect
  to school improvement and new regulations. We believe that we do have some schools
  without single-sex bathrooms, primarily because they only have a very small number
  of students or only serve male or only female students. Fundamentally, this block
  of indicators is not policy-relevant for the United States. Rather than reporting
  missing, we are reporting 100 percent which we know is close to the U.S. value and
  reflects the relatively high quality of the education infrastructure in the United
  States.
comments_and_limitations: The values are estimated, but we are quite sure that the
  actual values for all of them approach 100 percent.

indicator_definition: The percentage of schools by level of education (primary, lower
  secondary and upper secondary) with access to the given facility or service. Internet
  for pedagogical purposes is defined as Internet that is available for enhancing
  teaching and learning and is accessible by pupils. Internet for pedagogical purposes
  is defined as a worldwide interconnected computer network, which provides pupils
  access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries
  e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (i.e.
  not assumed to be only via a computer) and thus can also be accessed by mobile telephone,
  tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed narrowband,
  fixed broadband, or via mobile network. Basic drinking water is defined as a functional
  drinking water source (MDG 'improved' categories) on or near the premises and water
  points accessible to all users during school hours. Basic sanitation facilities
  are defined as functional sanitation facilities (MDG 'improved' categories) separated
  for males and females on or near the premises. Basic handwashing facilities are
  defined as functional handwashing facilities, soap (or ash) and water available
  to all girls and boys. The component on adapted infrastructure and materials is
  yet to be developed.

us_method_of_computation: NCES is estimating the percentages of public schools having
  these basic facilities at 100 percent. There was a survey in 2008 that found that
  98 percent of public schools had computers for student use. We believe the percentage
  has increased since that date.
