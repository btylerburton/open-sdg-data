indicator_definition: 'Proportion of surface area of transboundary basins that have
  an operational arrangement for transboundary water cooperation. Regular meetings
  of the riparian countries to discuss IWRM and exchange of information are required
  for an arrangement to be defined as "operational".Concepts: Integrated Water Resources
  Management (IWRM) is an approach to managing water in a coordinated way. It takes
  into account the different water sources as well as various users and uses in a
  given situation, with the aim of maximizing positive social, economic and environmental
  benefits. It uses catchments and aquifers, as the principle unit of water management,
  and stresses decentralization of governance structures and active stakeholder participation
  in decision making. Transboundary basins are surface water or groundwater basins
  (aquifers) which cross or are located on boundaries between two or more States.
  An agreement, institutional arrangement and/or an established organization provides
  a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Such a framework
  is commonly based on an agreement covering different aspects of transboundary water
  management. Agreements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial or
  interagency. In addition to an agreement (e.g. a treaty, convention, Memorandum
  of Understanding), such framework can be provided by a bilateral or multilateral
  commission or other appropriate institutional arrangements for cooperation. Furthermore,
  multi-sectoral cooperation institutions can cover for water issues. For a cooperation
  framework to be considered as "operational", it requires that there are regular
  meetings of the riparian countries to discuss the integrated management of the water
  resource and to exchange information.'

method_of_computation: Calculated ' for any spatial unit (country, region) ' as the
  percentage that the total surface area (in km2) of transboundary basins that have
  an operational arrangement for water cooperation makes up of the total surface area
  of transboundary basins (km2). GIS data on the extent and location of transboundary
  basins facilitates the spatial analysis, corresponding datasets available globally.

rationale_interpretation: "Target 6.5 stresses the importance of transboundary cooperation\
  \ to implement integrated water resources management of shared basins, to ensure\
  \ availability and sustainable management of water resources. \nMost of the world's\
  \ water resources are shared: transboundary lake and river basins cover nearly one\
  \ half of the Earth's land surface and account for an estimated 60% of global freshwater.\
  \ Approximately 40% of the world's population lives in transboundary river and lake\
  \ basins and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. However, cooperation\
  \ on shared water resources is in most cases not advanced. \nThe single most important\
  \ factor enabling transboundary water cooperation is the existence of a cooperation\
  \ framework (agreement, institution or other adequate arrangement) and it being\
  \ operational, i.e. ensuring regular dialogue and exchange between riparian countries."
