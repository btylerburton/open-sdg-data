comments_and_limitations: "National Prisoners Statistics (NPS) - Started in 1926 under\
  \ a mandate from Congress, NPS collects annual data on prisoners at yearend. The\
  \ Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) sponsors the survey, and the U.S. Census Bureau\
  \ serves as the data collection agent. The NPS distinguishes between inmates in\
  \ custody and prisoners under jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a state\
  \ or the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) must hold that inmate in one of its facilities.\
  \ To have jurisdiction over a prisoner, the state or BOP must have legal authority\
  \ over that prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or supervised.\
  \ The NPS jurisdiction counts include persons held in prisons, penitentiaries, correctional\
  \ facilities, halfway houses, boot camps, farms, training or treatment centers,\
  \ and hospitals. Counts also include prisoners who were temporarily absent (less\
  \ than 30 days), in court, or on work release; housed in privately operated facilities,\
  \ local jails, or other state or federal facilities; and serving concurrent sentences\
  \ for more than one correctional authority. The NPS custody counts include all inmates\
  \ held within a respondent’s facilities, including inmates housed for other correctional\
  \ facilities. The custody counts exclude inmates held in local jails and in other\
  \ jurisdictions. With a few exceptions, the NPS custody counts exclude inmates held\
  \ in privately operated facilities. Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) - In years between\
  \ a complete census of local jails, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducts\
  \ the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). ASJ uses a stratified probability sample of\
  \ jail jurisdictions to estimate the number and characteristics of local inmates\
  \ nationwide. In the sampling design, the jail jurisdictions nationwide are grouped\
  \ into 10 strata. In 2016, the 10 strata were defined by two variables: the jail\
  \ jurisdiction average daily population (ADP), and whether the jurisdiction held\
  \ at least one juvenile. For 8 of the 10 strata, a random sample of jail jurisdictions\
  \ was selected. For the remaining two strata, all jurisdictions were included in\
  \ the sample. One stratum consisted of all jails that were operated jointly by two\
  \ or more jurisdictions (referred to as multi-jurisdictional jails). The other stratum\
  \ (referred to as certainty stratum) consisted of all jail jurisdictions that held\
  \ juvenile inmates at the time of the 2013 Census of Jail Inmates and had an ADP\
  \ of 500 or more inmates during the 12 months ending December 31, 2013; or held\
  \ only adult inmates and had an ADP of 750 or more; or were located in California;\
  \ or were known to be operating in 2015 but were not included n the 2013 Census\
  \ of Jails. BJS obtains data from sampled jail jurisdictions by mailed and web-based\
  \ survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone calls, the item response rate for\
  \ jails that responded to the 2016 survey was nearly 97%. BJS implements nonresponse\
  \ weight adjustment procedures to account for unit nonresponse and a weighted sequential\
  \ hot-deck/cold-deck imputation procedure for critical items. See BJS website for\
  \ questionnaires and additional metadata: https://www.bjs.gov/. Note: (1)\tAnnual\
  \ jail inmate estimates are subject to sampling error. The standard error for the\
  \ percentage unconvicted was 0.45% in 2016. (2)\tEstimates for 2000-2014 were based\
  \ on mid-year jail populations (typically June 30). Estimates for 2015-2016 were\
  \ based on year-end prison populations (December 31). (3)\tUnsentenced state and\
  \ federal prisoner counts exclude an unknown number held in privately operated facilities."

indicator: 16.3.2
indicator_definition: The total number of persons held in detention who have not yet
  been sentenced, as a percentage of the total number of persons held in detention,
  on a specified date. 'Sentenced' refers to persons subject to criminal proceedings
  who have received a decision from a competent authority regarding their conviction
  or acquittal. For the purposes of the indicator, persons who have received a 'non-final'
  decision (such as where a conviction is subject to appeal) are considered to be
  'sentenced'.

method_of_computation: Annual enumeration of state and federal prisoners and annual
  sample survey of jail jurisdictions to provide total number of prison and jail inmates
  and number unsentenced in custody
national_geographical_coverage: United States
periodicity: Annual
published: true
rationale_interpretation: The indicator signifies overall respect for the principle
  that persons awaiting trial shall not be detained in custody. This, in turn, is
  premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. From
  a development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence detention when not necessary
  for reasons such as the prevention of absconding, the protection of victims or witnesses,
  or the prevention of the commission of further offences, can divert criminal justice
  system resources, and exert financial and unemployment burdens on the accused and
  his or her family. Measuring the relative extent to which pre-sentence detention
  is used can provide the evidence to assist countries in lowering such burdens and
  ensuring its proportionate use.
