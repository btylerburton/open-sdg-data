method_of_computation: "From UN-WOMEN: Denominator: All Member States, for federal\
  \ states this will be reflected in central governments' self-reporting.  Sources\
  \ of information and methodology: The suggested methodology consists of initial\
  \ self-reporting by governments through a detailed survey to be developed based\
  \ on the indicators below with detailed questions that safeguard the replicability\
  \ and reliability of state responses. This procedure was applied for the ICPD+20\
  \ review survey with support to governments from UNFPA's country offices where needed.\
  \ The self-reported data will undergo validation and qualitative assessment by responsible\
  \ UN agencies assigned to the task. At this stage other stakeholders and data sources\
  \ could be consulted, e.g. National Human Rights Institutions, human rights treaty\
  \ bodies or other international, regional or national monitoring bodies. From UNFPA:\
  \  Methodology and feasibility of data collection \tThe indicator will measure the\
  \ number of countries with legal and regulatory frameworks guaranteeing access to\
  \ sexual and reproductive services, education and information without any of the\
  \ above restrictions. Therefore, to count as a \"yes\" all the four requirements\
  \ included in this indicator will need to be met: (i) access without third party\
  \ authorization; (ii) access without age restrictions; (iii) access irrespective\
  \ of marital status; and (iv) access to education and information at all levels.\
  \ For countries counting as \"no\", nevertheless, data will be disaggregated in\
  \ accordance to each of those requirements to be able to measure progress on each\
  \ particular front. Sources of information and methodology: \tThe suggested methodology\
  \ consists of initial self-reporting by governments through a detailed survey to\
  \ be developed based on the indicators below with detailed questions that safeguard\
  \ the replicability and reliability of state responses. This procedure was successfully\
  \ applied for the ICPD+20 review survey with support to governments from UNFPA's\
  \ country offices where needed. \tInformation provided by States can be complemented\
  \ with information from UN treaty monitoring bodies, including the Committee on\
  \ Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Committee on the\
  \ Rights of the Child and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\
  \ These three committees are systematically collecting information and issuing recommendations\
  \ to State parties on all the issues covered by this indicator. A combined use of\
  \ these three committees as sources of information will ensure near universal coverage\
  \ of States and will also increase the periodicity of information. \tMoreover, other\
  \ actors with a monitoring role such as regional human rights mechanisms, national\
  \ human rights institutions and civil society organizations often provide information\
  \ on the components covered by this indicator. UN agencies such as WHO, UNFPA and\
  \ UN Women also compile country specific information on legal and regulatory developments\
  \ on issues pertaining to their respective mandates."
