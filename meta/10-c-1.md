rationale_interpretation: Remittances are an important private source of income for
  migrant families. They benefit wider communities and improve the human development
  of migrant households. With total remittances going to developing countries projected
  at USD 454 billion in 2015, reaching the target of reducing remittances to less
  than 3% would save more than USD 20 billion/year. The G20 has already committed
  to reducing the transfer costs of remittances (with 5 percentage points over five
  years), the so'called '5x 5 initiative'. To monitor this commitment, a designated
  group in the World bank was created to monitor the implementation of this commitment.
