target: Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption
  by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including
  by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist,
  to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs
  and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts
  on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities.
