actual_indicator_available: Mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease, malignant
  neoplasms, diabetes and chronic lower respiratory disease
actual_indicator_available_description: US mortality rate due to combined causes of
  death related to malignant neoplasms, diabetes mellitus, major cardiovascualar diseases
  and chronic lower respiratory diseases.  Crude and age-adjusted rates are both available.
comments_and_limitations: Rates were generated by CDC Wonder using the Underlying
  Cause of Death mortality files. Rates were selected based on the ICD-10 113 Cause
  of Death listing.

  diseases.

method_of_computation: 'Number of deaths between ages 30 and 70 years due to the four
  causes / Number of years of exposure. Method of measurement Deaths from these four
  causes will be based on the following ICD codes: 100-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98.
  Method of estimation Modelling, using multiple inputs, is often used if no complete
  and accurate data are available. Age standardization is done for comparability over
  time and between populations.'

  through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.

title: Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic
  respiratory disease
un_custodial_agency: WHO
un_designated_tier: '1'
us_method_of_computation: The crude rate is calculated as the number of deaths due
  to combined causes as identified by ICD-10 codes C00-C97 (malignant neoplasms),
  E10-E14 (diabetes mellitus), I00-I78 (major cardiovascular disease) and J40-J47
  (chronic lower respiratory diseases) divided by by the US population.  Rates are
  age-adjusted using the direct method of applying age-specific death rates to the
  U.S. standard population distribution. See http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age-Adjusted
  Rates for more detail.
