indicator: 15.5.1
indicator_definition: Definition The Red List Index is a multi-purpose indicator which
  measures the aggregate change in extinction risk across groups of species. It is
  based on the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red
  List of Threatened Species. This indicator is expressed as an index ranging from
  0 to 1. Concepts Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened
  Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e.,
  species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction
  in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the proportion of species
  threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and changing
  taxonomy. The IUCN Red List Index (RLI) therefore accounts for such changes to yield
  a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of threatened species. It
  measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species over time,
  resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual
  species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been
  assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice.

rationale_interpretation: "The world's species are impacted by a number of threatening\
  \ processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive\
  \ alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. This indicator\
  \ can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species\
  \ as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated.\
  \ \nThe IUCN RLI value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as 'Least Concern')\
  \ to 0 (all species are categorized as 'Extinct'). An intermediate value indicates\
  \ how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the IUCN\
  \ RLI allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of\
  \ extinction risk (i.e., how threatened they are on average), and in the rate at\
  \ which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the IUCN RLI over time\
  \ means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e.,\
  \ the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected\
  \ rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is\
  \ decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions\
  \ is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity\
  \ loss has stopped. An upward IUCN RLI trend would indicate that the SDG Target\
  \ 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened\
  \ species is on track towards halting the loss of biodiversity and thus preventing\
  \ the extinction of threatened species by 2020. An IUCN RLI value of 1 would indicate\
  \ that biodiversity loss has been halted. \nThe name \"Red List Index\" should not\
  \ be taken to imply that the indicator is produced as a composite indicator of a\
  \ number of disparate metrics, in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional\
  \ Poverty Index is compiled. Rather, the RLI is an indicator of trends in species'\
  \ extinction risk, as measured using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria,\
  \ and is compiled from data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each\
  \ species, excluding any changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy."
