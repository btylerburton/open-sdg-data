indicator: 14.c.1
indicator_definition: This indicator conveys the number of countries that have ratified
  the ILO Maritime Labour Convention of 2006. ILO conventions are legally binding
  international treaties drawn up by the ILO's constituents (governments, employers
  and workers) and setting out basic principles and rights at work. The ILO Maritime
  Labour Convention (MLC) is a single, coherent instrument embodying as far as possible
  all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour conventions and
  recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other international
  labour conventions.

rationale_interpretation: This comprehensive convention sets out in one place seafarers'
  rights to decent conditions of work on almost every aspect of their working and
  living conditions including, among others, minimum age, employment agreements, hours
  of work or rest, payment of wages, paid annual leave, repatriation at the end of
  contract, onboard medical care, the use of licensed private recruitment and placement
  services, accommodation, food and catering, health and safety protection and accident
  prevention and seafarers' complaint handling. It represents an essential step toward
  ensuring fair competition and a level-playing field for quality owners of ships
  flying the flags of ratifying countries. Given that these international legal measures
  are aimed at improving working and living conditions for seafarers, the most globalized
  of the world's workers, the number of countries that have ratified the ILO Maritime
  Labour Convention gives an indication of the situation of maritime workers around
  the world.
