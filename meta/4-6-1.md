actual_indicator_available: Percentage of 16- to 65-year-olds performing at PIAAC
  literacy or numeracy level 3 or higher, by sex, age group, and high/low income quartile
actual_indicator_available_description: "PIAAC measures literacy and numeracy in both\
  \ paper and computer modes. Items that measure problem solving in technology-rich\
  \ environments are only computer-administered. Reading components tasks are only\
  \ administered in the paper-and-pencil mode. All participating countries are required\
  \ to assess the literacy and numeracy domains, but the problem solving and reading\
  \ components domains are both optional. The United States assessed all four domains.\
  \ PIAAC tasks developed for all four domains are authentic, culturally appropriate,\
  \ and drawn from real-life situations that are expected to be of importance or relevance\
  \ in different contexts. Tasks' contents and questions are intended to reflect the\
  \ purposes of adults' daily lives across cultures, even if they are not necessarily\
  \ familiar to all adults in all countries. Variable name                  Variable\
