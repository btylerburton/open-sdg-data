indicator: 15.6.1
indicator_definition: 'This indicator builds on concrete cases in which agreement
  has been reached on the transfer of genetic resources between the resource provider
  and the resource recipient, including on how benefits arising from the use of the
  genetic resources will be shared. Parties to the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic
  Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization
  to the Convention on Biological Diversity (Nagoya Protocol) that subject access
  to genetic resources to prior informed consent are obliged under Article 6 (3)e
  of the Nagoya Protocol to issue a "permit or its equivalent as evidence of the decision
  to grant prior informed consent and of the establishment of mutually agreed terms."
  The ABS Clearinghouse will make permits available online: https://absch.cbd.int/.
  The Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) is a mandatory contract that Parties
  to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture
  (International Treaty) have agreed to use whenever plant genetic resources falling
  under the Treaty''s Access and Benefit-sharing mechanism are made available. The
  SMTA defines the conditions of use of the plant genetic resources as well as the
  benefitsharing conditions. According to the SMTA providers shall inform the Governing
  Body about the Standard Material Transfer Agreements entered into. In addition,
  recipients who transfer resources received under a SMTA to third parties shall do
  so under the terms and conditions of the SMTA and shall notify the Governing Body.
  SMTAs are stored in the Data Store of the International Treaty. As of 21 August
  2015, the Data Store has recorded 34,898 SMTAs from providers located in 30 countries,
  distributing material to recipients based in 172 countries. (https://mls.planttreaty.org/itt/index.php?r=stats/pubStats).
  It should be noted that the number of permits or their equivalents and the number
  of SMTAs does not necessarily equal the number of samples/ accessions made available.
  Many permits/ SMTAs cover a large number of samples/ accessions.'
