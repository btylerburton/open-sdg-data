rationale_interpretation: "Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation\
  \ of human rights. Child marriage often compromises a girl's development by resulting\
  \ in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting\
  \ her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased\
  \ risk of intimate partner violence. In many cultures, girls reaching puberty are\
  \ expected to assume gender roles associated with womanhood. These include entering\
  \ a union and becoming a mother. \nThe issue of child marriage is addressed in a\
  \ number of international conventions and agreements: The Convention on the Elimination\
  \ of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (Article 16); Universal Declaration\
  \ of Human Rights; Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and\
  \ Registration of Marriages; African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child;\
  \ and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People's Rights on the Rights\
  \ of Women in Africa. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in the Convention\
  \ on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to other rights ' such as\
  \ the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection from all forms of\
  \ abuse, and the right to be protected from harmful traditional practices."
