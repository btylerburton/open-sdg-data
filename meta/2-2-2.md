actual_indicator_available: 'Percent of children under 5 years with weight-for-height/length
  <2 standard deviations below (wasting) or >2 standard deviations above (overweight)
  the median weight-for-length/height '
comments_and_limitations: Estimates reported pertain to the 2-year pooled NHANES data.
  The estimates for percent wasting and overweight met the NCHS standards for reliability
  and precision and the confidence interval width for both estimates was less than
  5 percent.

target: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the
  internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years
  of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating
  women and older persons.

title: Prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or <-2 standard deviation
  from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years
  of age, by type (wasting and overweight)
un_custodial_agency: 'UNICEF (Partnering agencies: WHO)'
un_designated_tier: '1'
us_method_of_computation: The NHANES data were merged with the expanded WHO growth
  chart files of weight-for-length/height for boys and girls by age. For the wasting
  estimate, the number of children 5 and younger with weight-for-length/height 2 or
  more standard deviations below the median weight-for-length/height was divided by
  the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result was multiplied
  by 100. For the overweight estimate, the number of children with weight-for-length/height
  2 or more standard deviations above the median weight-for-length/height was divided
  by the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result was multiplied
  by 100. The numbers and resulting estimates are weighted to be nationally representative.
