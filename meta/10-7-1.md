method_of_computation: Recruitment cost borne by agricultural workers, domestic workers
  and construction workers divided by yearly income earned in country of destination
national_geographical_coverage: United States
published: true
rationale_interpretation: Migrant workers often pay recruitment agencies sums amounting
  to several months' expected wage. This contravenes the ILO Private Employment Agencies
  Convention commitment to abolish such fees. These fees disproportionately affect
  low-skilled, lowincome workers from low-income countries. By reducing recruitment
  costs the disposable incomes of low-income workers are increased and inequalities
  are reduced by enabling people who could otherwise not afford to seek employment
  abroad to do so without ending up in debt bondage.
