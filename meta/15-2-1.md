indicator: 15.2.1
indicator_definition: "Sustainable forest management is a central concept for Goal\
  \ 15 and target 15.1 as well as for target 15.2. It has been formally defined, by\
  \ the UN General Assembly, as follows: [a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims\
  \ to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types\
  \ of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations\". (Resolution A/RES/62/98)\
  \ An \"index of sustainable forest management\" with four sub-indicators can be\
  \ used as a basic indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management by\
  \ a country. The four sub-indicators are \t1. Annual average percent change in forest\
  \ area over most recent available 5 year period \t2. Annual average percent change\
  \ in stock of carbon in above ground biomass over most recent available 5 year period\
  \ \t3. Share of forest area whose primary designated function is biodiversity conservation,\
  \ most recent period \t4. Share of forest area under a forest management plan, of\
  \ which forest area certified under an independent forest management certification\
  \ scheme, most recent period For each of these components, countries can set national\
  \ targets, monitor and report on progress. The four sub-indicators will be combined\
  \ into a single composite index, but targets would be set at the level of sub-indicators.\
  \ Once targets have been set by national authorities, in terms of the four sub-indicators,\
  \ and progress measured over an agreed period, countries would assess progress (on\
  \ track to exceed target, on track to achieve target, progress but at an insufficient\
  \ rate, no significant overall progress, moving away from target). The final value\
  \ of the index would be a simple arithmetic average of the values for the four sub-indicators.\
  \ The use of national targets allows each country to define sustainable forest management\
  \ for its own specific circumstances, within a coherent international framework.\
  \ Targets on the sub-indicators can also be set at regional or global levels."

rationale_interpretation: "The definition of SFM by UN GA contains several key aspects,\
  \ notably that sustainable forest management is a concept which varies over time\
  \ and between countries, whose circumstances ' ecological, social and economic '\
  \ vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest values,\
  \ including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational\
  \ equity into account. \nClearly a simple measure of change in forest area, while\
  \ essential, and used for target 15.1, is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest\
  \ management as a whole. The index proposed combines the two indicators at present\
  \ under consideration (\"forest loss\" and \"area certified\") with measures of\
  \ use/degradation (sub-indicator 2), biodiversity conservation (sub-indicator 3)\
  \ to give a more rounded picture of sustainable forest management. Further \"topical\"\
  \ sub-indicators will be needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of SFM\
  \ aspects. The significance of the four sub-indicators may be briefly explained\
  \ as follows: \n\t1. Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM: clearly,\
  \ if there is significant uncontrolled deforestation, forest management is not sustainable.\
  \ The indicator focuses on change as there is no ideal share of forest in land cover,\
  \ as the share is determined by history, ecological circumstances and competing\
  \ land uses. The indicator covers the net effect of the other parts of Target 15.2:\
  \ \"halt deforestation\" and \"substantially increase afforestation and reforestation\"\
  . However most countries have reliable data on the components of this overall trend\
  \ (deforestation, afforestation and reforestation), for which separate targets can\
  \ be specified, if so desired. This component incorporates the concept of \"net\
  \ permanent forest loss \" at present classified \"green\" and is also used for\
  \ Target 15.1 \n\t2. Changes in the stock of biomass are determined by the balance\
  \ between increase in volume of wood biomass (annual increment) and decrease (natural\
  \ losses and damage by fire insects etc., and wood harvest). In a sustainably managed\
  \ forest, increment is more than losses, so that the biomass stock increases, or\
  \ does not decrease, and carbon is sequestered from the atmosphere. With very few\
  \ exceptions, a decline in total biomass stocks, even if the forest area does not\
  \ decrease, implies unsustainable management (and possible degradation). As the\
  \ wood/carbon ratio is constant, there will be exactly the same trends for carbon\
  \ stocks as for wood biomass. Therefore a single indicator addresses carbon stocks\
  \ and flows and trends in growing stock of wood, and may be expressed in m3 of wood\
  \ or in tons of carbon. \n\t3. Forest areas managed for the conservation of biodiversity\
  \ are a proxy for trends in forest biodiversity and a clear indication of political\
  \ will to incorporate biodiversity into forest management. The CBD Aichi Target\
  \ 11 calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and\
  \ inland water areas, so this may be taken as a goal for this element. Work is in\
  \ hand on developing a number of indicators of forest biodiversity, which may be\
  \ useful in the future. \n\t4. The fourth parameter looks at the area within a country\
  \ where a key tool for sustainable forest management is applied. The existence of\
  \ a \"forest management plan\" is a necessary tool for evidence based, long term\
  \ management. Those areas that are certified by third party schemes as being sustainably\
  \ managed work on the basis of an independently verified management plan. While\
  \ the latter fulfils a higher standard, it should be pointed out that there are\
  \ very significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not certified,\
  \ either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary\
  \ and market-based) or because no credible (or affordable) certification scheme\
  \ is in place for that area. The latter is true for most tropical countries. For\
  \ this reason, using \"area of certified forest\" as the sole indicator could give\
  \ a misleading impression."
