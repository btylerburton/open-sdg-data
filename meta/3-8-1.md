method_of_computation: Number of people receiving the intervention'/ Number of people
  who need the intervention Method of measurement Universal health coverage means
  that people receive the services they need, without incurring financial hardship.
  Countries progressively realize UHC according to their level of development, epidemiological
  situation, health system and people's expectations.''The indicators ideally cover
  promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliation. There are a number
  of indicators that all countries implement such as immunization coverage or skilled
  attendance at birth that can be used for a summary measure of progress that can
  be used at lgobal and regional and country levels. Countries however will also create
  their own set of indicators to track progress towards UHC.'' The selection of indicators
  is based on the initial framework, and was applied in the global report published
  in 2015 by WHO and the World Bank.''This provides a basis for further improvements
  working alongside countries. Method of estimation The indicators can be expressed
  as a summary measure. These can be weighted according to indicator, or intervention
  area. Work on incorporating an equity component in the summary measure is ongoing
  but is possible in a relatively simple manner.
